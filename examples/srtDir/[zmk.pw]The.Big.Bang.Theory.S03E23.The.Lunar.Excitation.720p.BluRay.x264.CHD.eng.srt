1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000

2
00:00:03,820 --> 00:00:06,600
okay,we've got power to the laser.

3
00:00:06,760 --> 00:00:09,250
i should've brought an umbrella.

4
00:00:09,390 --> 00:00:10,440
what for?it's not going to rain.

5
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:16,630
i know that,but with skin as fair as mine,moon burn is a real possibility.

6
00:00:16,780 --> 00:00:18,620
that's a "bazinga," right?

7
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:21,300
one of my best,don't you think?

8
00:00:23,770 --> 00:00:26,550
howard,do you want to double-check the equatorial mount on the laser?

9
00:00:26,690 --> 00:00:28,470
we need it locked onto the sea of tranquility.

10
00:00:28,630 --> 00:00:30,060
you got it.

11
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:31,950
oh,raj,no.

12
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:36,860
billions of dollars have gone into inventing the internet and filling it with pictures of naked women,

13
00:00:37,010 --> 00:00:40,050
so we don't have to peep through windows.

14
00:00:40,210 --> 00:00:40,760
it's not like that.

15
00:00:40,930 --> 00:00:42,220
i'm watching someone's tv.

16
00:00:42,380 --> 00:00:45,420
the good wifeis on.

17
00:00:45,580 --> 00:00:50,010
i tell you,this is my newgrey's anatomy.

18
00:00:50,180 --> 00:00:50,860
leonard,leonard.

19
00:00:51,020 --> 00:00:53,250
what is that?what is that?

20
00:00:53,410 --> 00:00:55,960
relax,it's just a dirty sock.

21
00:00:56,130 --> 00:01:01,060
how on earth can you say "dirty sock" and "relax" in the same sentence?

22
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:05,560
sheldon,the world is filled with dirty discarded socks.

23
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:08,630
not my world.

24
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:11,840
g bang theory hey,you know who'd really dig seeing this experiment?penny.

25
00:01:12,010 --> 00:01:15,120
i wasn't aware that lunar ranging was her thing.

26
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:22,460
although,i suppose the retro-reflector left on the moon by neil armstrong does qualify as a shiny object.

27
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:23,960
why don't you ask her to come up?

28
00:01:24,110 --> 00:01:26,370
i don't know,it's still a little weird since,you know...

29
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:27,530
she dumped you?

30
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:28,490
she didn't dump me.

31
00:01:28,650 --> 00:01:30,790
we were just in different places in the relationship.

32
00:01:30,930 --> 00:01:35,970
i fail to see how a relationship can have the qualities of a geographic location.

33
00:01:36,110 --> 00:01:36,970
oh,it's very simple.

34
00:01:37,150 --> 00:01:40,280
leonard was living in a little town called "please don'oryt leave me"

35
00:01:40,450 --> 00:01:46,170
while penny had just moved to the island of "buh-bye.

36
00:01:47,330 --> 00:01:47,990
" screw you guys.

37
00:01:48,170 --> 00:01:50,540
i'm gonna go see if she's home.

38
00:01:50,690 --> 00:01:54,070
if it's not too much trouble,i'd like to point this at the moon now.

39
00:01:54,230 --> 00:01:54,760
wait a second.

40
00:01:54,930 --> 00:01:57,630
the good wife is crying.

41
00:01:57,770 --> 00:02:00,430
something's very wrong.

42
00:02:19,470 --> 00:02:21,780
the.big.bang.theory.
Season 03 Episode 23

43
00:02:29,140 --> 00:02:30,520
oh,hi.what's going on?

44
00:02:30,690 --> 00:02:33,960
we're up on the roof bouncing laser beams off the moon.

45
00:02:34,150 --> 00:02:35,630
i'm sorry,what?

46
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:36,440
it's pretty cool.

47
00:02:36,610 --> 00:02:38,550
we've got a two-meter parabolic reflector and everything.

48
00:02:38,690 --> 00:02:39,940
i thought you might want to see it.

49
00:02:40,090 --> 00:02:42,000
man: that makes no sense.

50
00:02:42,430 --> 00:02:44,320
how can you bounce stuff off the moon?

51
00:02:44,470 --> 00:02:47,040
there's no gravity.

52
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,280
penny: uh,leonard,this is zack.

53
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:50,430
zack,leonard.

54
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:52,020
oh,sorry,i didn't know you were busy.

55
00:02:52,180 --> 00:02:53,660
- maybe another time.
- yeah,maybe.

56
00:02:53,830 --> 00:02:55,150
hey,i want to see this laser thing.

57
00:02:55,310 --> 00:02:57,080
oh,but what about the party?

58
00:02:57,230 --> 00:03:00,690
it's a surprise party-- doesn't matter when we get there.

59
00:03:01,340 --> 00:03:02,640
right.

60
00:03:03,350 --> 00:03:06,860
okay,well,yeah,come on up.

61
00:03:11,270 --> 00:03:12,900
so,how'd you guys meet?

62
00:03:13,070 --> 00:03:16,410
my company designs the menus for the cheesecake factory.

63
00:03:16,570 --> 00:03:17,230
your company?

64
00:03:17,390 --> 00:03:20,810
well,my dad.but me and my sister are vps.

65
00:03:21,030 --> 00:03:22,340
so...

66
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:23,670
menus.

67
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:30,140
i know it sounds easy,but there's a lot of science that goes into designing them.

68
00:03:33,260 --> 00:03:33,960
happy now?

69
00:03:34,130 --> 00:03:36,850
i'm moving the dirty sock.

70
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:39,900
thank you.

71
00:03:40,170 --> 00:03:43,140
raj,keep an eye out for the other one.

72
00:03:43,540 --> 00:03:45,980
hey,guys,this is my friend zack.

73
00:03:47,370 --> 00:03:48,670
is that the laser?

74
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:51,190
it's bitchin'.

75
00:03:51,380 --> 00:03:52,120
yes.

76
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:56,630
in 1917,when albert einstein established the theoretic foundation

77
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:59,890
for the laser in his paper "zur quantentheorie der strahlung,

78
00:04:00,050 --> 00:04:05,890
"his fondest hope was that the resultant device be bitchin'.

79
00:04:06,030 --> 00:04:08,760
well,mission accomplished.

80
00:04:10,150 --> 00:04:11,840
let me explain what we're doing here.

81
00:04:12,020 --> 00:04:16,700
um,in 1969,the astronauts onapollo 11 positioned reflectors on the surface of the moon,

82
00:04:16,850 --> 00:04:18,700
and we're going to shoot a laser off one of them

83
00:04:18,860 --> 00:04:22,470
and let the light bounce back into this photomultiplier.

84
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:23,740
that's very cool.

85
00:04:23,890 --> 00:04:25,070
zack: one question.

86
00:04:25,210 --> 00:04:28,110
how can you be sure it won't blow up?

87
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:29,010
the laser?

88
00:04:29,190 --> 00:04:31,320
the moon.

89
00:04:33,130 --> 00:04:36,980
see,now this is a man for penny.

90
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:39,320
that's a great question,zack.

91
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:40,180
no,it's not.

92
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:41,350
penny: sheldon!

93
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:42,150
play nice.

94
00:04:42,330 --> 00:04:43,530
it's not a great question.

95
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:48,460
how could somebody possibly think we're going to blow up the moon?

96
00:04:48,610 --> 00:04:50,910
that'sa great question.

97
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:53,050
don't worry about the moon.

98
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:56,170
we-we set our laser to stun.

99
00:04:56,330 --> 00:04:57,850
smart.

100
00:04:58,150 --> 00:05:00,040
now,we'll be able to see the beam when it leaves,

101
00:05:00,190 --> 00:05:03,100
but it won't be strong enough when it comes back to be seen by the naked eye.

102
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:05,150
naked.

103
00:05:09,510 --> 00:05:10,470
right.

104
00:05:10,710 --> 00:05:12,090
funny.

105
00:05:12,290 --> 00:05:16,880
uh,that device,there,will measure the photons that return and let us see it on this computer.

106
00:05:17,050 --> 00:05:19,110
raj,get them some glasses.

107
00:05:19,270 --> 00:05:22,590
cool,it's gonna be in 3-d?

108
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:30,030
preparing to fire laser at the moon.

109
00:05:30,190 --> 00:05:32,140
make it so.

110
00:05:36,050 --> 00:05:36,650
there it is.

111
00:05:36,850 --> 00:05:38,440
there's the spike!

112
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:40,060
2.5 seconds for the light to return.

113
00:05:40,220 --> 00:05:40,860
that's the moon!

114
00:05:41,030 --> 00:05:42,600
we hit the moon!

115
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:47,910
that's your big experiment?

116
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:49,970
all that for a line on the screen?

117
00:05:50,140 --> 00:05:53,210
leonard: yeah,but,uh,think about what this represents.

118
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:56,570
the fact that we can do this is the only way of definitively proving that

119
00:05:56,730 --> 00:05:58,900
there are man-made objects on the moon,

120
00:05:59,060 --> 00:06:04,010
put there by a member of a species that only 60 years before had just invented the airplane.

121
00:06:04,170 --> 00:06:06,840
what species is that?

122
00:06:08,740 --> 00:06:09,850
i was wrong.

123
00:06:09,990 --> 00:06:11,730
penny can do better.

124
00:06:11,870 --> 00:06:13,870
okay,guys,thank you,it's been fun.

125
00:06:14,020 --> 00:06:14,760
yeah,thanks.

126
00:06:14,930 --> 00:06:15,820
should we invite them to the party?

127
00:06:15,990 --> 00:06:18,200
no,just keep walking.

128
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:22,430
he must be very skilled at coitus.

129
00:06:24,030 --> 00:06:25,220
i'm telling you,dude,

130
00:06:25,390 --> 00:06:34,070
the only way to feel better about penny going out with other guys is for you to get back on the whores.

131
00:06:34,310 --> 00:06:36,140
horse.

132
00:06:36,310 --> 00:06:41,660
- what?
- the phrase is "get back on the horse," not "whores.

133
00:06:41,810 --> 00:06:44,510
" that's disgusting,dude.

134
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:46,560
no,it's not...

135
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:48,540
never mind.

136
00:06:48,770 --> 00:06:50,040
he is right,though.

137
00:06:50,210 --> 00:06:53,830
if you want,i can turn you on to this great new dating site i found.

138
00:06:53,980 --> 00:06:54,880
no,thanks.

139
00:06:55,020 --> 00:06:57,310
you sure?they say they can find a match for anybody.

140
00:06:57,460 --> 00:06:58,990
have they found a match for you?

141
00:06:59,150 --> 00:06:59,800
tons.

142
00:06:59,970 --> 00:07:01,920
i've had,like,eight dates in the last month.

143
00:07:02,070 --> 00:07:05,510
and 12 if you count the ones who showed up and left.

144
00:07:05,670 --> 00:07:07,410
i can't bring the nitrogen tank down.

145
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:08,310
why not?

146
00:07:08,460 --> 00:07:09,360
all right,let me restate that.

147
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:13,050
it's very heavy,and i don't want to.

148
00:07:13,190 --> 00:07:13,950
i'll help you.

149
00:07:14,130 --> 00:07:15,540
thank you.

150
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:19,170
lift with your knees,not your back.

151
00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:21,070
good night.

152
00:07:23,170 --> 00:07:24,940
you know what wouldbe fun?

153
00:07:25,110 --> 00:07:28,140
signing sheldonup for online dating.

154
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:28,840
yeah,right.

155
00:07:29,030 --> 00:07:29,790
no,think about it.

156
00:07:29,940 --> 00:07:31,210
we make it an experiment.

157
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:35,950
like when frankenstein's monster was lonely and he found a wife.

158
00:07:36,130 --> 00:07:38,090
he didn'tfinda wife.

159
00:07:38,250 --> 00:07:42,430
theybuilt hima wife out of dead body parts.

160
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:45,650
okay,we'll call that plan b.

161
00:07:51,010 --> 00:07:52,640
coming!

162
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:58,850
damn you,you rat bastard.

163
00:07:58,990 --> 00:07:59,800
are you drunk?

164
00:07:59,970 --> 00:08:03,840
zack was a perfectly nice guy,and then you ruined him!

165
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,330
how did iruin him?

166
00:08:05,490 --> 00:08:11,260
'cause in the olden days,i never would've known he was so stupid.

167
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:14,550
come on,he wasn't that stupid.

168
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:15,910
yes,he was!

169
00:08:16,090 --> 00:08:19,770
he thought you were gonna blow up the moon!

170
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:22,500
****

171
00:08:22,670 --> 00:08:30,190
********************

172
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:33,410
how is thatmyfault?

173
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:36,300
you have destroyed my ability to tolerate idiots.

174
00:08:36,460 --> 00:08:37,760
now,come with me.

175
00:08:37,910 --> 00:08:38,620
wh-where are we going?

176
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:40,250
we're gonna have sex.

177
00:08:40,430 --> 00:08:43,380
why?i mean,okay.

178
00:08:44,860 --> 00:08:46,190
what's going on?

179
00:08:46,350 --> 00:08:51,440
put on your noise- canceling headphones,'cause it's gonna get loud.

180
00:08:52,630 --> 00:08:55,990
notthisagain.

181
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:11,700
In what universe is this low-pulp?

182
00:09:14,860 --> 00:09:16,850
good morning,penny.

183
00:09:17,030 --> 00:09:19,120
what,do you have eyes in the back of your head?

184
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:21,940
when one gets beaten up every other day in school,

185
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:26,070
one of necessity develops a keen sense of hearing.

186
00:09:26,250 --> 00:09:32,630
incidentally,one can get beaten up in school simply by referring to oneself as "one.

187
00:09:32,790 --> 00:09:33,900
" s i'm making english muffins.

188
00:09:34,070 --> 00:09:35,370
would you like an english muffin?

189
00:09:35,580 --> 00:09:37,240
oh,thanks,i'm not hungry.

190
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:43,060
fyi,my noise-canceling headphones proved ineffective last night.

191
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:44,590
yeah,sorry about that.

192
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:50,500
as a native texan,i must say i've never heard the phrase "yee-haw" used in quite that context.

193
00:09:50,660 --> 00:09:52,460
oh,god.

194
00:09:52,850 --> 00:09:54,980
"oh,god.

195
00:09:55,130 --> 00:09:59,000
" that i've heard on multiple occasions.

196
00:10:01,930 --> 00:10:06,650
in what universe is that lightly toasted?

197
00:10:08,740 --> 00:10:12,260
this has to be the worst day of my life.

198
00:10:13,030 --> 00:10:14,900
good morning,leonard.

199
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:17,610
how many times have i asked you not to do that?

200
00:10:17,780 --> 00:10:21,750
counting this instance? 317.

201
00:10:22,790 --> 00:10:23,790
where's penny?

202
00:10:23,980 --> 00:10:25,460
she returned to her apartment.

203
00:10:25,630 --> 00:10:27,360
i presume to shower and vomit.

204
00:10:27,530 --> 00:10:30,480
not necessarily in that order.

205
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:33,010
i wonder why she didn't say good-bye.

206
00:10:33,180 --> 00:10:37,180
are you expecting me to offer an explanation of human behavior?

207
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:38,730
i know.i just thought as an outsider,

208
00:10:38,890 --> 00:10:45,560
you might be able to provide a fresh perspective.

209
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:49,950
i havenodifficulty believing you're not butter.

210
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:54,270
***

211
00:10:54,270 --> 00:10:55,100
um,i gotta run.

212
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:56,080
early shift.

213
00:10:56,250 --> 00:10:57,920
okay,i'll walk down with you.

214
00:10:58,080 --> 00:11:00,190
so,last night was fun,huh?

215
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:01,330
yeah,it must have been.

216
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:04,230
i just threw up in my closet.

217
00:11:04,830 --> 00:11:05,830
bummer.

218
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:08,360
anyway,i was thinking tonight maybe we could catch a movie.

219
00:11:08,510 --> 00:11:10,610
oh,yeah,tonight's not great for me.

220
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:11,580
doesn't have to be tonight.

221
00:11:11,740 --> 00:11:14,840
i'm free pretty much always.

222
00:11:15,010 --> 00:11:17,700
leonard,last night was a mistake.

223
00:11:17,860 --> 00:11:23,970
when you say "mistake," do you mean a fortunate mistake,like the discovery of penicillin?

224
00:11:24,140 --> 00:11:25,220
look,i'm sorry.

225
00:11:25,410 --> 00:11:28,030
i was drunk,i was lonely,i hated zack.

226
00:11:28,180 --> 00:11:29,910
can we just forget it ever happened?

227
00:11:30,070 --> 00:11:33,140
no,it's pretty well imprinted on my brain.

228
00:11:33,290 --> 00:11:35,320
especially the whole rodeo thing.

229
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:36,760
oh,god!

230
00:11:36,910 --> 00:11:37,890
so,that's it?

231
00:11:38,050 --> 00:11:39,800
wham,bam,thank you,leonard?

232
00:11:39,990 --> 00:11:40,850
look,i said i'm sorry.

233
00:11:41,010 --> 00:11:42,090
can't you please let it go?

234
00:11:42,260 --> 00:11:43,460
how am i supposed to let it go?

235
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:46,690
you used me for sex!

236
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:51,400
morning,mrs.gunderson.

237
00:11:51,570 --> 00:11:52,600
good morning,leonard.

238
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:57,280
or should i say "yee-haw"?

239
00:12:03,460 --> 00:12:04,980
holy crap.

240
00:12:05,150 --> 00:12:05,820
what?

241
00:12:05,990 --> 00:12:10,010
we finally have proof that aliens walk among us.

242
00:12:10,170 --> 00:12:10,810
excuse me?

243
00:12:10,970 --> 00:12:14,410
the dating site matched a woman with sheldon.

244
00:12:14,550 --> 00:12:15,220
you're kidding.

245
00:12:15,380 --> 00:12:16,440
an actual woman?

246
00:12:16,610 --> 00:12:17,590
yeah,look.

247
00:12:17,740 --> 00:12:19,740
breasts and everything.

248
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:23,120
trust me,breasts doesn't necessarily mean woman.

249
00:12:23,270 --> 00:12:24,130
since when?

250
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:29,910
i'll show you a picture of my uncle louie in a bathing suit sometime.

251
00:12:30,910 --> 00:12:32,210
leonard,you gotta see this.

252
00:12:32,370 --> 00:12:34,000
we found a match for sheldon.

253
00:12:34,170 --> 00:12:34,690
leonard: great.

254
00:12:34,870 --> 00:12:35,940
maybe she can have sex with him,

255
00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:40,960
and then walk out on him the next morning without so much as a "how do you do?

256
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:41,980
" do you know what he's talking about?

257
00:12:42,140 --> 00:12:43,200
nope.why don't you ask him?

258
00:12:43,350 --> 00:12:44,340
leonard,what are you talking about?

259
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:45,500
i don't want to talk about it.

260
00:12:45,650 --> 00:12:48,060
that was a lousy suggestion.

261
00:12:48,190 --> 00:12:48,990
whatever.

262
00:12:49,140 --> 00:12:54,230
right now,dr.sheldon cooper has to send an e-mail to his perfect match.

263
00:12:54,380 --> 00:12:58,850
"greetings,fellow life-form...

264
00:13:00,620 --> 00:13:01,760
" if she can do it,i can do it.

265
00:13:01,910 --> 00:13:02,920
if she can do it,i can do it.

266
00:13:03,070 --> 00:13:05,220
if she can do it,i can do it.

267
00:13:06,570 --> 00:13:08,090
i can't do it.

268
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,260
hello?

269
00:13:10,420 --> 00:13:14,130
hi,leslie.

270
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:15,340
leonard hofstadter.

271
00:13:15,490 --> 00:13:16,480
what're you doing here?

272
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:17,690
uh,i know!

273
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:18,750
it's been a while!

274
00:13:18,910 --> 00:13:20,660
yeah,18 months.

275
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:21,670
right.

276
00:13:21,830 --> 00:13:22,960
right.

277
00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:26,000
so how you doing?

278
00:13:26,230 --> 00:13:26,920
fine.

279
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:27,940
you?

280
00:13:28,110 --> 00:13:29,260
uh,not bad.

281
00:13:29,410 --> 00:13:33,730
you remember when we used to have sex and you said that it didn't mean anything,

282
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:35,000
t was just for fun?

283
00:13:35,170 --> 00:13:36,600
yeah.

284
00:13:36,740 --> 00:13:40,770
you,uh,want to do that again?

285
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:42,770
what happened?blondie dumped you?

286
00:13:42,930 --> 00:13:43,560
she didn't dump me.

287
00:13:43,730 --> 00:13:46,780
we were just in different places in the relationship.

288
00:13:46,940 --> 00:13:47,880
right.

289
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:50,180
anyway,apparently,

290
00:13:50,340 --> 00:13:56,120
it's okay to go back to people you're no longer seeing and have recreational sex with them.

291
00:13:56,830 --> 00:13:59,080
so,what do you say?

292
00:13:59,220 --> 00:14:01,180
let me think about it.

293
00:14:07,890 --> 00:14:09,910
she's not coming back.

294
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:16,170
she wants to meet us.

295
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:17,250
not us.him.

296
00:14:17,410 --> 00:14:20,230
yes,but him doesn't even know about her.

297
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:23,330
well,him about to find out about her.

298
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:25,940
really?us gonna tell him?

299
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:28,220
who's going to tell whom about what?

300
00:14:28,370 --> 00:14:29,590
sheldon.

301
00:14:30,490 --> 00:14:32,550
your surprise confuses me.

302
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:34,760
i live here.

303
00:14:35,540 --> 00:14:36,370
right.

304
00:14:36,530 --> 00:14:40,410
so,listen,what are you doing tomorrow afternoon?

305
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:41,870
be more specific.

306
00:14:42,020 --> 00:14:42,800
4:30.

307
00:14:42,970 --> 00:14:44,160
that's not afternoon.

308
00:14:44,310 --> 00:14:46,630
that's preevning.

309
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:47,320
what?

310
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:49,360
it's a time of day i invented.

311
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:55,430
it better defines the ambiguous period between afternoon and evening: preevning.

312
00:14:55,580 --> 00:14:59,530
i'm fairly certain it will catch on as it fills a desperate need.

313
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:00,300
right,okay.

314
00:15:00,470 --> 00:15:02,260
what are you doing tomorrow preevning?

315
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:04,230
well,tomorrow's saturday.

316
00:15:04,390 --> 00:15:06,260
saturday night is laundry night.

317
00:15:06,410 --> 00:15:11,060
so i'll be spending the preevning pre-sorting and pre-soaking.

318
00:15:11,220 --> 00:15:14,530
okay,what if i were to tell you,tomorrow,at 4:30,

319
00:15:14,670 --> 00:15:19,610
you could meet a woman who has been scientifically chosen to be your perfect mate?

320
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:22,550
i would snort in derision and throw my arms in the air,

321
00:15:22,700 --> 00:15:26,290
exhausted by your constant tomfoolery.

322
00:15:26,450 --> 00:15:28,810
but it's true.

323
00:15:30,290 --> 00:15:33,850
but we-we put all your vital information into this dating site,

324
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:37,230
answered all their questions just like you would,and they found a match for you.

325
00:15:37,390 --> 00:15:39,810
her name is amy farrah fowler.

326
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:40,600
please.

327
00:15:40,750 --> 00:15:43,520
even assuming you could answer any question the way i would,

328
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:46,720
the algorithms used by matchmaking sites are complete hokum.

329
00:15:46,890 --> 00:15:51,800
and that's exactly the answer we gave to the question: "what is your attitude towards online dating?

330
00:15:51,970 --> 00:15:54,830
" howard wanted to write "mumbo jumbo," but i said no.

331
00:15:54,970 --> 00:15:59,170
our sheldon would say "hokum.

332
00:16:00,340 --> 00:16:03,010
" come on,where's your scientific curiosity?

333
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:06,090
well,most of it is being applied to unraveling the secrets of the universe

334
00:16:06,250 --> 00:16:10,050
while the rest of it's wondering why i'm having this conversation with you.

335
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:11,740
okay,how about this.

336
00:16:11,890 --> 00:16:15,210
even spock had a date once every seven years.

337
00:16:15,350 --> 00:16:16,220
he didn't date.

338
00:16:16,390 --> 00:16:17,570
it waspon farr.

339
00:16:17,710 --> 00:16:20,930
his blood boiled with mating lust.

340
00:16:21,070 --> 00:16:23,030
well,why-why don't you start with a cup of coffee,

341
00:16:23,250 --> 00:16:27,030
and you canpon farr amy farrah fowler later.

342
00:16:27,190 --> 00:16:28,350
i don't drink coffee.

343
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:30,050
all right,you can have a hot chocolate.

344
00:16:30,210 --> 00:16:34,030
as i will not be engaging in this nonsense,my choice of beverage is moot.

345
00:16:34,180 --> 00:16:39,180
but for the record,i only drink hot chocolate in months with an "r" in them.

346
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:40,050
why?

347
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:42,740
what's life without whimsy?

348
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:47,050
okay,i'm out.

349
00:16:52,260 --> 00:17:00,180
sheldon,i've hidden the dirty sock from the roof somewhere in your apartment.

350
00:17:00,350 --> 00:17:07,250
unless you are willing to come with us to meet this girl,it will remain there forever.

351
00:17:07,430 --> 00:17:09,280
you're bluffing.

352
00:17:09,420 --> 00:17:12,750
are you willing to risk it?

353
00:17:12,930 --> 00:17:15,190
curse you.

354
00:17:37,190 --> 00:17:38,760
30 feet.

355
00:17:46,970 --> 00:17:47,880
hey,leonard.

356
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:55,120
i was a perfectly happy,geeky,little lonely guy,and you ruined me!

357
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:56,160
are you drunk?

358
00:17:56,310 --> 00:17:56,910
come on.

359
00:17:57,080 --> 00:18:00,360
we're gonna have sex,and it's not gonna mean a thing!

360
00:18:00,490 --> 00:18:03,240
are you out of your mind?!

361
00:18:05,050 --> 00:18:09,100
i'm really starting to think there's a double standard here.

362
00:18:13,570 --> 00:18:17,750
in a few minutes,when i gloat over the failure of this enterprise,

363
00:18:17,890 --> 00:18:19,170
how would you prefer i do it?

364
00:18:19,300 --> 00:18:20,730
the standard "i told you so"?

365
00:18:20,870 --> 00:18:22,430
the classic "neener-neener"?

366
00:18:22,580 --> 00:18:26,370
or just my normal look of haughty derision?

367
00:18:27,610 --> 00:18:29,040
you don't know we're wrong yet.

368
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:31,280
haughty derision it is.

369
00:18:32,460 --> 00:18:33,340
woman: excuse me.

370
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:34,490
i'm amy farrah fowler.

371
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:36,200
you're sheldon cooper.

372
00:18:36,350 --> 00:18:38,100
hello,amy farrah fowler.

373
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:40,820
i'm sorry to inform you that you have been taken in

374
00:18:40,970 --> 00:18:45,070
by unsupportable mathematics designed to prey on the gullible and the lonely.

375
00:18:45,220 --> 00:18:49,600
additionally,i'm being blackmailed with a hidden dirty sock.

376
00:18:49,750 --> 00:18:53,340
if that was slang,i'm unfamiliar with it.

377
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:58,090
if it was literal,i share your aversion to soiled hosiery.

378
00:18:58,230 --> 00:18:58,820
heory in any case,

379
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:02,790
i'm here because my mother and i have agreed that i will date at least once a year.

380
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:04,010
interesting.

381
00:19:04,180 --> 00:19:07,730
my mother and i have the same agreement about church.

382
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:09,460
i don't object to the concept of a deity,

383
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:13,850
but i'm baffled by the notion of one that takes attendance.

384
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:17,200
well,then you might want to avoid east texas.

385
00:19:17,350 --> 00:19:18,320
noted.

386
00:19:18,460 --> 00:19:19,610
now,before this goes any further,

387
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:26,810
you should know that all forms of physical contact up to and including coitus are off the table.

388
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:30,380
may i buy you a beverage?

389
00:19:30,530 --> 00:19:33,110
tepid water,please.

390
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:43,620
good god,what have we done?
