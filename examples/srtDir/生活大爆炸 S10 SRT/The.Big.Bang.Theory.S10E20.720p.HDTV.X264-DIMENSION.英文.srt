10
00:00:02,280 --> 00:00:03,720
Hey, Leonard, if you're not busy tomorrow,

11
00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:05,790
I have to do a little reception after work.

12
00:00:05,790 --> 00:00:06,760
Oh, I would,

13
00:00:06,760 --> 00:00:09,290
but we need to make a push on the air force project.

14
00:00:09,290 --> 00:00:10,270
Oh, are you sure?

15
00:00:10,270 --> 00:00:12,000
We're celebrating our new A.D.D. Drug,

16
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,550
and it'll probably be over in, like, six minutes.

17
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,350
Did you say you guys are working on the guidance system tomorrow?

18
00:00:18,350 --> 00:00:19,440
Yeah, why?

19
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:21,040
Well, Sheldon said that he was gonna work with me

20
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:23,190
on our quantum perception project.

21
00:00:23,190 --> 00:00:24,830
We've had this planned for a week.

22
00:00:24,830 --> 00:00:26,610
Well, he reconfirmed with me this morning.

23
00:00:26,610 --> 00:00:28,660
Guys, before this gets ugly, remember,

24
00:00:28,660 --> 00:00:31,440
the winner gets Sheldon.

25
00:00:32,130 --> 00:00:34,040
Hey, Raj, do you want to go with me tomorrow?

26
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:36,640
Are you asking because you want me there or out of pity?

27
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:38,150
Actually, never mind, don't answer.

28
00:00:38,150 --> 00:00:39,640
I'd love to.

29
00:00:41,710 --> 00:00:42,420
Hello.

30
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:43,630
Why did you tell Leonard you're working on

31
00:00:43,630 --> 00:00:46,440
- the gyroscope tomorrow? - Because I am.

32
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:48,000
But you said you were working with me.

33
00:00:48,710 --> 00:00:52,960
Someone's got two dates to the nerd prom.

34
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:56,740
I have a plan to work on both projects simultaneously.

35
00:00:56,740 --> 00:00:59,340
And for your information, the summer conference

36
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:03,490
on algebraic topology at Caltech is nerd prom.

37
00:01:04,150 --> 00:01:05,950
I'm sorry, what is this plan you have?

38
00:01:05,950 --> 00:01:08,870
Well, I'm not needed at both places at the same time.

39
00:01:08,870 --> 00:01:11,630
And I can also free up extra hours with simple tricks,

40
00:01:11,630 --> 00:01:15,180
such as using a minimal amount of words to convey my point.

41
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:17,470
When does that start?

42
00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:19,850
Soon.

43
00:01:19,850 --> 00:01:21,160
See, I could've said "In the near future,"

44
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:22,230
but I didn't say "In the near future,"

45
00:01:22,230 --> 00:01:25,500
'cause "In the near future" is three more words than "Soon."

46
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:28,260
"In" one, "the" two, "near" three, "future" four.

47
00:01:28,260 --> 00:01:30,200
See "In the near future" is four, "Soon" is just one,

48
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:33,690
four is more than one; saving time already.

49
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:36,310
Genius.

50
00:01:36,310 --> 00:01:36,950
I was gonna say,

51
00:01:36,950 --> 00:01:39,590
"Why does anyone think Sheldon's a genius?"

52
00:01:39,590 --> 00:01:42,130
But I didn't.

53
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:15,300
Gentlemen, I've got Amy up and running.

54
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:16,440
Shall we get to work?

55
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:19,010
Uh, before we do, what are you wearing,

56
00:02:19,010 --> 00:02:21,940
oh, friend who we pretend is normal?

57
00:02:21,940 --> 00:02:24,520
These are hydration backpacks.

58
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:26,900
Eh, for efficiency, whenever I'm thirsty,

59
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:28,260
I have access to water.

60
00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:31,810
Eh, when I'm hungry, I have lentil soup.

61
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:35,300
It's getting harder to pretend.

62
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:37,200
Anyway, Sheldon, we're at a decision point

63
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:39,100
to run the xenon stream through the cryocooler

64
00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:40,570
or through the vacuum filter.

65
00:02:40,570 --> 00:02:42,730
Run down the pros and cons of each for me.

66
00:02:42,730 --> 00:02:44,710
Well, if we run the xenon stream through the cryocooler,

67
00:02:44,710 --> 00:02:48,040
it'll be cooled immediately before it reacts with the conduction.

68
00:02:51,770 --> 00:02:55,440
Oh, sorry, uh, carrot chunk.

69
00:02:56,890 --> 00:03:00,030
You can just feel the time being saved.

70
00:03:00,910 --> 00:03:04,000
Ah, I'm back, you got me for eight minutes.

71
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,300
Sheldon, this is silly.

72
00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:07,160
You can't expect us to do quality work

73
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:08,910
with you popping in and out like this.

74
00:03:08,910 --> 00:03:11,330
The coefficient isn't lambda, it's lambda sub one.

75
00:03:11,330 --> 00:03:13,480
And over here, you should consider the possibility

76
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:15,830
that the brain itself is in two different quantum states.

77
00:03:15,830 --> 00:03:19,380
And lastly, do you have any little soup crackers?

78
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:22,940
The rate of spinning for the central axis centrifuge

79
00:03:22,940 --> 00:03:24,930
has to be four revolutions per second.

80
00:03:24,930 --> 00:03:27,510
It can't be four revolutions, it's got to be seven.

81
00:03:27,510 --> 00:03:28,210
Seven?!

82
00:03:28,210 --> 00:03:29,860
Look at the board, it's four.

83
00:03:29,860 --> 00:03:30,970
Oh, my God, it's seven!

84
00:03:30,970 --> 00:03:31,910
- Four! - Seven!

85
00:03:31,910 --> 00:03:34,060
It's five and a half.

86
00:03:34,060 --> 00:03:37,080
Son of a bitch, it's five and a half.

87
00:03:37,380 --> 00:03:39,800
B.R.B., that's short for "Be right back."

88
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:42,490
I'm saving so much time!

89
00:03:43,090 --> 00:03:45,310
The two signals meet up in the corpus callosum

90
00:03:45,310 --> 00:03:47,900
and T equals zero.

91
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:51,380
And I know a boy who just earned a slurp of soup.

92
00:03:52,010 --> 00:03:53,350
Incredible.

93
00:03:53,350 --> 00:03:55,860
Sheldon, I didn't expect that you could work on both projects,

94
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:57,660
but I, I was wrong.

95
00:03:57,660 --> 00:03:59,540
You know, I felt the same way about the spork.

96
00:03:59,540 --> 00:04:02,250
Uh, solids and liquids handled by one utensil?

97
00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:03,810
That'll never work.

98
00:04:03,810 --> 00:04:06,900
And spoiler: works.

99
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:07,730
I got to admit,

100
00:04:07,730 --> 00:04:09,910
we didn't think you'd be able to do two things at once.

101
00:04:09,910 --> 00:04:12,720
Yeah, I felt the same way about the platypus.

102
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:14,820
You know, bird and mammal in the same creature?

103
00:04:14,820 --> 00:04:15,770
No way.

104
00:04:15,770 --> 00:04:19,340
And spoiler: way.

105
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:25,900
Oh, thanks again for letting me use your laptop last night.

106
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:27,240
No problem.

107
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:29,060
Was just doing my taxes.

108
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:30,250
Okay.

109
00:04:30,250 --> 00:04:31,540
Actually, if I could...

110
00:04:31,540 --> 00:04:32,760
if I could just check one more...

111
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:34,040
Already cleared the browser history.

112
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:36,450
You're a good woman.

113
00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:38,540
What you working on?

114
00:04:38,540 --> 00:04:41,550
Trying to catch up on office e-mails before I go back.

115
00:04:41,550 --> 00:04:44,640
Oh, that's right, maternity leave's almost over.

116
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:46,320
Ah, you excited?

117
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:49,420
Yeah, I mean, I'll miss Halley,

118
00:04:49,420 --> 00:04:51,670
but it'll be nice to get out of the house,

119
00:04:51,670 --> 00:04:53,750
be intellectually stimulated.

120
00:04:53,750 --> 00:04:58,980
Go out to lunch instead of, you know, be lunch.

121
00:04:58,980 --> 00:05:01,160
That's great, good for you.

122
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:04,170
Yeah, I mean, with you and my parents,

123
00:05:04,170 --> 00:05:05,160
she's gonna be fine.

124
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:06,450
Ah, of course she is.

125
00:05:06,450 --> 00:05:07,730
And that day care is great.

126
00:05:07,730 --> 00:05:09,340
It is. I went to check it out,

127
00:05:09,340 --> 00:05:12,780
and they are very cautious about letting strange men with no kids

128
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:15,590
peek in the windows.

129
00:05:17,170 --> 00:05:20,430
Plus, I, I think I'm setting a good example for Halley,

130
00:05:20,430 --> 00:05:22,410
to show her that women can be mothers

131
00:05:22,410 --> 00:05:24,680
and still have satisfying careers.

132
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:27,980
Sure, she won't know where I went or if I'm ever coming back.

133
00:05:27,980 --> 00:05:29,680
That'll just make the ten minutes between when I get home

134
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:34,010
and her bedtime even more special.

135
00:05:34,010 --> 00:05:37,080
Uh, other than burp you or give you a bottle,

136
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:40,000
I don't know what to do right now.

137
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,560
It's okay, I'm just being emotional about this.

138
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:45,570
Can you not tell Howard?

139
00:05:45,570 --> 00:05:47,730
Well, don't you think it'd be healthier

140
00:05:47,730 --> 00:05:49,830
if you told him what's going on with you?

141
00:05:49,830 --> 00:05:50,950
Don't you think it'd be healthier

142
00:05:50,950 --> 00:05:54,190
if you had your own apartment, grown man?

143
00:05:55,190 --> 00:05:58,590
Your secret is safe with me.

144
00:06:01,140 --> 00:06:04,240
Hey, since when do you do laundry on a Thursday?

145
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:06,490
Oh, I had an accident at work,

146
00:06:06,490 --> 00:06:10,420
I slipped and fell on my soup sack.

147
00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:13,670
You know, there was a time I would say "What's a soup sack?"

148
00:06:13,670 --> 00:06:17,820
But... I'm glad we're past that.

149
00:06:19,950 --> 00:06:22,460
You know, there was a time I would say "God bless you,"

150
00:06:22,460 --> 00:06:25,140
and then you would say "If you must invoke an imaginary deity,

151
00:06:25,140 --> 00:06:26,590
how about Thor?"

152
00:06:26,590 --> 00:06:27,940
And I would say,

153
00:06:27,940 --> 00:06:29,470
"How do you know I didn't mean Thor?"

154
00:06:29,470 --> 00:06:30,890
And then you would say "Touche,"

155
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:32,160
and that there ends the tale

156
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:35,920
of why I no longer say "God bless you."

157
00:06:36,430 --> 00:06:37,960
Well, we have had some fun, haven't we?

158
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:39,900
Oh, yeah.

159
00:06:40,420 --> 00:06:42,300
So, Leonard tells me you've had a busy day.

160
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:43,420
Oh, I did.

161
00:06:43,420 --> 00:06:44,560
It hasn't stopped.

162
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:47,220
I figured out a solution for our navigation system

163
00:06:47,220 --> 00:06:50,760
while I was pre-soaking lentils out of my pants.

164
00:06:51,750 --> 00:06:53,080
Are you getting sick?

165
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:54,150
Of course not.

166
00:06:54,150 --> 00:06:55,480
I'm too busy to be sick.

167
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:56,560
Well, you're pretty delicate.

168
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:58,440
Maybe you shouldn't be pushing yourself so hard.

169
00:06:58,440 --> 00:06:59,860
- I'm fine. - All right.

170
00:06:59,860 --> 00:07:02,080
Well, we'll just pretend that you didn't catch a cold

171
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:04,290
- watching Frozen. - I...

172
00:07:04,290 --> 00:07:05,500
That didn't happen.

173
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:07,000
You also got a nosebleed watching Up.

174
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,550
Just do your laundry!

175
00:07:12,590 --> 00:07:14,820
Stuart, you didn't have to make dinner.

176
00:07:14,820 --> 00:07:17,760
Yeah, well, I felt bad about upsetting you this morning.

177
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:22,220
And to be honest, I'm not the biggest fan of your meatloaf.

178
00:07:23,140 --> 00:07:24,660
Hey, what's for dinner?

179
00:07:24,660 --> 00:07:25,620
Meatloaf.

180
00:07:25,620 --> 00:07:27,350
Oh, cool.

181
00:07:27,350 --> 00:07:28,220
Stuart made it.

182
00:07:28,220 --> 00:07:30,450
Oh, cool.

183
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:33,490
Hey, I was thinking maybe we take

184
00:07:33,810 --> 00:07:35,330
Halley to the zoo this weekend,

185
00:07:35,330 --> 00:07:36,780
get in a little family time

186
00:07:36,780 --> 00:07:38,660
before you go back to work.

187
00:07:39,020 --> 00:07:40,000
Sounds great.

188
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:40,600
Speaking of which,

189
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:42,790
for day care, it'll be easy for me

190
00:07:42,790 --> 00:07:45,860
to drop her off, unless you want to do it.

191
00:07:45,860 --> 00:07:48,030
Hmm, guess it should be me.

192
00:07:48,030 --> 00:07:49,060
I can't do it;

193
00:07:49,060 --> 00:07:53,000
they have a picture of me on file now.

194
00:07:57,540 --> 00:07:58,890
You okay?

195
00:07:58,890 --> 00:08:00,390
Of course, why?

196
00:08:00,390 --> 00:08:02,560
Well, I don't know, you seem a little upset.

197
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:04,300
- No, I'm fine. - You sure?

198
00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:05,640
Why don't you think she's fine?

199
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:07,500
She sounds fine, she looks fine.

200
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:08,900
If I saw her on the street I'd say,

201
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:12,020
"Damn, that girl's fine!"

202
00:08:15,660 --> 00:08:17,630
Sheldon, you're sick, go back to bed.

203
00:08:17,630 --> 00:08:19,830
I am fine.

204
00:08:19,830 --> 00:08:21,950
Here, eat your toast.

205
00:08:26,660 --> 00:08:28,680
Sorry.

206
00:08:29,620 --> 00:08:32,240
It's okay, now I don't need butter.

207
00:08:33,660 --> 00:08:36,470
Well, perhaps I am a little under the weather.

208
00:08:36,470 --> 00:08:39,370
It's nothing a little cold medicine and tea can't fix.

209
00:08:39,370 --> 00:08:40,560
You need sleep.

210
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:42,760
What I need is to get to work.

211
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:44,590
Well, I don't want your germs around me.

212
00:08:44,590 --> 00:08:47,290
What? You hold my hand, you kiss my mouth,

213
00:08:47,290 --> 00:08:50,750
but you draw the line at 102 fever?

214
00:08:51,060 --> 00:08:53,300
What happened to our love?

215
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:59,960
Sheldon, are you okay?

216
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:03,550
What's going on?

217
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:06,310
How'd I get here?

218
00:09:06,310 --> 00:09:08,960
I don't know, we came home from work and we found you.

219
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:11,340
Home from work?

220
00:09:11,340 --> 00:09:12,560
What time is it?

221
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:13,590
9:00.

222
00:09:13,590 --> 00:09:15,290
9:00?!

223
00:09:15,290 --> 00:09:17,090
W-What happened to 8:00 and 7:00

224
00:09:17,090 --> 00:09:19,550
and all the other o'clocks?

225
00:09:19,550 --> 00:09:21,300
Wait, you don't remember?

226
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:24,890
Well, I remember waking up in the morning,

227
00:09:24,890 --> 00:09:27,710
Amy rubbing Vicks on my chest.

228
00:09:27,710 --> 00:09:31,860
And her hands were like two frozen chunks of tundra.

229
00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:35,180
I took some cold medicine to...

230
00:09:36,350 --> 00:09:38,780
I took cold medicine.

231
00:09:38,780 --> 00:09:40,010
You did seem a little loopy

232
00:09:40,010 --> 00:09:41,540
when you showed up at the lab.

233
00:09:41,540 --> 00:09:43,910
At-- at the lab?!

234
00:09:45,290 --> 00:09:48,620
Why am I naked from the waist down?

235
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:51,590
I don't know where your pants are,

236
00:09:51,590 --> 00:09:55,260
but we did find your underwear in a pot on the stove.

237
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:08,310
My pants are missing, I don't remember anything.

238
00:10:08,310 --> 00:10:11,380
Penny, this is your youth. What do I do?

239
00:10:12,870 --> 00:10:13,700
I don't know,

240
00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:16,800
check your body for tattoos?

241
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:19,090
Leonard, would you be a lamb...

242
00:10:19,090 --> 00:10:21,140
She's kidding!

243
00:10:23,460 --> 00:10:24,930
Wait, wait. Where's my bag?

244
00:10:24,930 --> 00:10:27,880
- My phone and my wallet are in my bag. - It's right here.

245
00:10:31,420 --> 00:10:34,270
Where's my notebook? My notebook's gone. Oh, no.

246
00:10:34,270 --> 00:10:36,140
Okay, it's just a notebook, what's the big deal?

247
00:10:36,140 --> 00:10:37,390
What's the big deal?

248
00:10:37,390 --> 00:10:40,140
It's full of classified information about the air force project!

249
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:42,460
How could you lose that?

250
00:10:42,460 --> 00:10:44,400
It's okay, I'm sure we'll find it.

251
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:46,870
Look, it's got to be around here somewhere.

252
00:10:46,870 --> 00:10:49,870
Maybe it's wherever your pants are.

253
00:10:50,510 --> 00:10:53,770
Nope, pants in the microwave, no notebook.

254
00:10:57,790 --> 00:10:59,910
Ah, hello.

255
00:10:59,910 --> 00:11:01,800
Look, something's going on with Bernadette.

256
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:03,500
She say anything to you?

257
00:11:03,870 --> 00:11:05,480
Well, nope, not a word.

258
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:07,390
Come on, be honest.

259
00:11:07,390 --> 00:11:10,380
Did you tell her I tried her breast pump?

260
00:11:15,510 --> 00:11:19,230
No, but I did mention it to my therapist.

261
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:24,300
Well, I know she's mad at me about something.

262
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:27,110
Well, what have you done that would upset her?

263
00:11:27,110 --> 00:11:31,480
Oh, gosh, how much time do you have?

264
00:11:31,930 --> 00:11:34,310
Well, why don't you just start with the worst thing?

265
00:11:34,310 --> 00:11:36,260
Hmm, let's see.

266
00:11:36,570 --> 00:11:39,110
Okay, here we go: six years ago,

267
00:11:39,110 --> 00:11:45,410
I got a call that Bernie's great-aunt, Trixie, died.

268
00:11:45,410 --> 00:11:46,990
And?

269
00:11:46,990 --> 00:11:49,860
And I forgot to give her the message.

270
00:11:51,490 --> 00:11:53,050
That's terrible.

271
00:11:53,050 --> 00:11:54,740
The terrible part is, ever since then,

272
00:11:54,740 --> 00:11:57,110
I've been sending Bernie

273
00:11:57,110 --> 00:12:00,130
Christmas cards from Trixie.

274
00:12:02,300 --> 00:12:03,100
Howard!

275
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:04,800
Let me finish-- and one card had five dollars in it

276
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:07,360
I took from Bernie's purse.

277
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:12,180
The notebook isn't in the bathroom.

278
00:12:12,180 --> 00:12:13,360
I can't find it, either.

279
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:15,180
How can he not remember a day?

280
00:12:15,180 --> 00:12:17,860
Well, people who are abducted by aliens lose time.

281
00:12:17,860 --> 00:12:21,670
I mean, maybe it happens to the aliens, too.

282
00:12:23,550 --> 00:12:25,170
Well, it's not across the hall.

283
00:12:25,170 --> 00:12:28,350
That's it. I'm in breach of my security clearance.

284
00:12:28,350 --> 00:12:30,100
I'm going to prison.

285
00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:33,250
And you know what happens to people like me in prison.

286
00:12:33,770 --> 00:12:37,730
I'll be forced to be some large man's tutor.

287
00:12:40,340 --> 00:12:42,520
You're not going to prison.

288
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:45,810
But, boy, it is funny to think about.

289
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:48,280
You really can't remember anything?

290
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:49,580
I'm trying.

291
00:12:49,580 --> 00:12:52,390
Wait a minute. Hey, let me see your phone.

292
00:12:52,390 --> 00:12:53,370
Why?

293
00:12:53,370 --> 00:12:54,640
Well, it's-- it's possible

294
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:56,580
it was tracking everywhere you went.

295
00:12:56,580 --> 00:12:57,560
Phones can do that?

296
00:12:57,560 --> 00:12:59,410
Yeah, it depends on the privacy settings.

297
00:12:59,410 --> 00:13:01,310
Oh, tha-- that's so cool.

298
00:13:01,310 --> 00:13:05,650
How do you-- how do you turn that thing off?

299
00:13:06,110 --> 00:13:06,940
Relax.

300
00:13:06,940 --> 00:13:10,150
I know when you "go for a run," you stop for a donut.

301
00:13:10,550 --> 00:13:13,170
I don't even run there, I drive.

302
00:13:15,580 --> 00:13:17,990
Hang on, I can see every place you went.

303
00:13:17,990 --> 00:13:19,030
What does it say?

304
00:13:19,030 --> 00:13:20,990
Uh, you were in the building,

305
00:13:20,990 --> 00:13:23,480
you were at the university,

306
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:26,870
then you were somewhere on Colorado Boulevard.

307
00:13:26,870 --> 00:13:27,910
Where?

308
00:13:27,910 --> 00:13:30,180
Wait, hang on.

309
00:13:30,180 --> 00:13:32,120
Did you go to a cowboy bar?

310
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:34,670
I-- no!

311
00:13:34,670 --> 00:13:37,740
That is preposterous.

312
00:13:45,150 --> 00:13:46,890
Maybe.

313
00:13:50,770 --> 00:13:52,620
Hey, how's it going?

314
00:13:52,620 --> 00:13:53,830
Fine.

315
00:13:53,830 --> 00:13:57,120
Good. Love you.

316
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:58,760
- Love you, too. - Love you more.

317
00:13:58,760 --> 00:14:02,320
Okay, you won. Can I finish what I'm doing?

318
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:05,790
Sure, sorry.

319
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:11,060
Something on your mind?

320
00:14:11,060 --> 00:14:12,820
No, no, nothing.

321
00:14:13,210 --> 00:14:15,730
Okay, well, maybe I'm just feeling like

322
00:14:15,730 --> 00:14:17,790
something's bothering you.

323
00:14:17,790 --> 00:14:19,570
Nope, all good.

324
00:14:19,570 --> 00:14:23,420
Prove it, make love to me right now on the kitchen floor.

325
00:14:24,230 --> 00:14:25,980
No, what is wrong with you?

326
00:14:25,980 --> 00:14:27,360
Aha, you are upset.

327
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:31,320
I don't know a lot about women, but I know I upset them.

328
00:14:32,950 --> 00:14:35,250
Howard, I'm sorry if I'm being weird,

329
00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:37,300
but it has nothing to do with you.

330
00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:38,540
It doesn't?

331
00:14:38,540 --> 00:14:40,020
No.

332
00:14:40,940 --> 00:14:43,070
I didn't want to tell you, but...

333
00:14:43,070 --> 00:14:46,150
I'm having a really tough time about going back to work.

334
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:48,870
Okay, well, I get that.

335
00:14:48,870 --> 00:14:51,480
It was hard for me when I went back.

336
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:52,660
- It was? - Of course.

337
00:14:52,660 --> 00:14:55,350
I missed you and the baby

338
00:14:55,350 --> 00:14:58,980
and being able to watch Ellen every day.

339
00:14:59,890 --> 00:15:02,450
I just don't know what the right thing to do is.

340
00:15:02,450 --> 00:15:04,980
If I go back to work, I'm abandoning Halley.

341
00:15:04,980 --> 00:15:06,160
If I don't go,

342
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:08,660
I'm giving up everything I worked for.

343
00:15:08,660 --> 00:15:10,940
It's like there's no right choice.

344
00:15:10,940 --> 00:15:14,630
Look, I don't know what the best decision is, either.

345
00:15:14,630 --> 00:15:18,870
But whatever we choose, if we're not happy,

346
00:15:18,870 --> 00:15:20,880
we can undo it.

347
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:21,690
I guess.

348
00:15:21,690 --> 00:15:24,610
And the best part is: Halley won't remember a thing.

349
00:15:24,970 --> 00:15:28,560
Babies are cute, but they're dumb.

350
00:15:28,850 --> 00:15:29,680
I mean, I-I go like this,

351
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:32,120
she thinks I'm gone. Then magically I'm back.

352
00:15:34,630 --> 00:15:37,510
Honestly, why are we saving for college?

353
00:15:39,110 --> 00:15:41,670
I'm not crazy about you calling our baby dumb.

354
00:15:41,670 --> 00:15:44,530
Well, she gets it from me.

355
00:15:44,530 --> 00:15:45,480
Speaking of which,

356
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:49,030
I have some news about your Aunt Trixie.

357
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:58,290
Does this place look familiar?

358
00:15:58,590 --> 00:16:00,110
It's hard to say.

359
00:16:00,110 --> 00:16:01,900
Hey, Sheldon's back!

360
00:16:01,900 --> 00:16:04,600
Sheldon!

361
00:16:05,630 --> 00:16:07,620
It's getting clearer.

362
00:16:08,710 --> 00:16:11,000
You gonna buy another round for the house?

363
00:16:11,270 --> 00:16:13,380
Uh, n-no, thank you.

364
00:16:13,380 --> 00:16:17,420
We now know why MasterCard sent me a fraud alert.

365
00:16:17,420 --> 00:16:19,090
Ask him.

366
00:16:19,090 --> 00:16:21,310
Um, yes.

367
00:16:21,310 --> 00:16:22,760
Howdy, partner.

368
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:25,540
Do you happen to recollect if I left a notebook

369
00:16:25,540 --> 00:16:27,570
in these here parts?

370
00:16:27,570 --> 00:16:29,190
These here parts?

371
00:16:29,190 --> 00:16:33,230
It's called fitting in. By the way, good luck.

372
00:16:33,230 --> 00:16:34,220
Here you go.

373
00:16:34,690 --> 00:16:35,750
Thank goodness!

374
00:16:35,750 --> 00:16:40,370
One top secret quantum guidance system.

375
00:16:40,370 --> 00:16:41,860
You understood the math?

376
00:16:41,860 --> 00:16:44,250
No, but Sheldon told me all about it.

377
00:16:44,250 --> 00:16:46,390
He told everybody.

378
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:49,210
That's just great.

379
00:16:49,210 --> 00:16:50,120
Oh, don't worry,

380
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:53,830
he made us pinky swear we'd keep it a secret.

381
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,510
I swear...

382
00:16:56,510 --> 00:16:58,310
I swear...

383
00:16:58,310 --> 00:17:00,090
...not to tell anyone...

384
00:17:00,090 --> 00:17:02,350
...not to tell anyone...

385
00:17:02,350 --> 00:17:04,730
...the top secret military information

386
00:17:04,730 --> 00:17:06,290
I'm about to tell you.

387
00:17:06,290 --> 00:17:08,650
The top secret military information

388
00:17:08,650 --> 00:17:10,920
I'm about to tell you.

389
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:13,640
We really need to skedaddle.

390
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:14,500
Thank you. Bye.

391
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:15,540
See you.

392
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:22,020
Should probably erase this.

393
00:17:30,710 --> 00:17:32,870
Thank you for making me tea.

394
00:17:32,870 --> 00:17:34,840
You're welcome. How is it?

395
00:17:38,270 --> 00:17:42,850
Yummy. And warm on my back.

396
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:45,940
Do you need anything else?

397
00:17:45,940 --> 00:17:48,230
You know exactly what I need.

398
00:17:48,230 --> 00:17:49,780
