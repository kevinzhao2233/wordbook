22
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:02,720
Previously on The Big Bang Theory...

23
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:04,230
- What's this? - Oh, nothing,

24
00:00:04,230 --> 00:00:05,560
just some math we don't need.

25
00:00:05,560 --> 00:00:06,900
This is a different approach.

26
00:00:06,900 --> 00:00:09,850
You trying to get the guidance system even smaller?

27
00:00:09,850 --> 00:00:11,960
It's just a... theory.

28
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:13,900
Well, it's not even worked out.

29
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:17,780
I want this.

30
00:00:18,710 --> 00:00:21,530
Uh, but we've already met the agreed upon specs.

31
00:00:21,530 --> 00:00:25,790
Going smaller would require weeks' worth of new computations.

32
00:00:25,790 --> 00:00:28,780
So get the kid with the two shirts to do it.

33
00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:32,120
Sir, I mean, if I may,

34
00:00:32,120 --> 00:00:34,150
uh, we've put a lot of thought and effort

35
00:00:34,150 --> 00:00:36,190
into this current prototype.

36
00:00:36,190 --> 00:00:37,960
It's a really elegant solution,

37
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:39,760
and most importantly, it works.

38
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:41,430
You both make excellent points.

39
00:00:41,430 --> 00:00:44,360
And thank you for presenting it so articulately.

40
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:46,330
Make this.

42
00:00:48,580 --> 00:00:49,890
Champagne,

43
00:00:49,890 --> 00:00:51,140
- champagne, - Thank you.

44
00:00:51,140 --> 00:00:55,490
and for the world's tallest second grader, apple juice.

45
00:00:55,910 --> 00:00:59,150
No bendy straw, some party.

46
00:00:59,150 --> 00:01:00,800
Hey, a-a toast.

47
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:02,250
Thank you all for your support

48
00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:04,310
while we worked on our Air Force project.

49
00:01:04,310 --> 00:01:05,350
And please know that

50
00:01:05,350 --> 00:01:06,760
we could not have done it without you,

51
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:07,580
so cheers.

52
00:01:07,580 --> 00:01:08,970
Cheers.

53
00:01:08,970 --> 00:01:10,680
You know, it's nice of you to acknowledge us,

54
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:12,270
but this is your accomplishment.

55
00:01:12,270 --> 00:01:14,460
Yeah, you guys did this all on your own.

56
00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:17,460
Without me.

57
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:19,520
To success without Raj.

58
00:01:21,190 --> 00:01:22,480
So what happens next?

59
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:23,350
Phase two,

60
00:01:23,350 --> 00:01:24,720
we test it, perfect it,

61
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:26,230
and hope to live long enough to see the movie

62
00:01:26,230 --> 00:01:29,690
based on our lives starring more attractive versions of us.

63
00:01:29,690 --> 00:01:31,510
Yeah, I'll definitely live long enough--

64
00:01:31,510 --> 00:01:33,730
vitamin C.

65
00:01:33,730 --> 00:01:35,640
First thing tomorrow morning, we're back at it.

66
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:38,090
Without me.

67
00:01:38,090 --> 00:01:40,050
I hope his character doesn't make it into the movie;

68
00:01:40,050 --> 00:01:42,670
he's kind of a bummer.

69
00:01:45,380 --> 00:01:46,750
Leonard Hofstadter.

70
00:01:46,750 --> 00:01:48,540
Access granted.

71
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:50,500
I don't care if this thing's burning out my retinas;

72
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:53,010
it makes me feel special.

73
00:01:53,010 --> 00:01:55,950
Now, before we field test, I think we...

74
00:01:58,620 --> 00:02:00,290
What the hell?

75
00:02:00,290 --> 00:02:01,370
Where is everything?

76
00:02:01,370 --> 00:02:03,320
Who else has access to this room?

77
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:05,720
It's a secure lab in a classified facility;

78
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:07,480
only the U.S. Government and us.

79
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:10,310
This is very disconcerting.

80
00:02:10,310 --> 00:02:14,230
But the movie did just get good.

81
00:02:38,950 --> 00:02:42,050
Sir, I-I-I'm sorry but I just don't get it.

82
00:02:42,050 --> 00:02:44,170
Y-You came into our lab in the middle of the night

83
00:02:44,170 --> 00:02:46,030
and took our prototype and all of our research

84
00:02:46,030 --> 00:02:48,060
and didn't even tell us?

85
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:50,570
Sounds like you get it.

86
00:02:51,970 --> 00:02:53,620
Well, why would you do that?

87
00:02:53,620 --> 00:02:56,640
You guys completed phase one, we'll take it from here.

88
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:58,160
Where did you move it?

89
00:02:58,160 --> 00:02:59,630
I can't tell you that.

90
00:02:59,630 --> 00:03:01,900
Are you implementing phase two?

91
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:03,410
I can't tell you that.

92
00:03:03,410 --> 00:03:05,090
Wait, so you're just going to take all the work

93
00:03:05,090 --> 00:03:08,160
we've done for the last year and toss us aside?

94
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:12,110
That one I can tell you, yes.

95
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:15,420
This is all very upsetting.

96
00:03:15,420 --> 00:03:16,880
I'm sorry to hear that.

97
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:19,660
As you know, the primary focus of the United States military

98
00:03:19,660 --> 00:03:23,000
is people's feelings.

99
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:27,930
If that's sarcasm, please save it for our enemies.

100
00:03:29,260 --> 00:03:30,820
Well, I may be moving out soon.

101
00:03:30,820 --> 00:03:32,090
I think I found a place to live.

102
00:03:32,090 --> 00:03:34,050
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.

103
00:03:34,050 --> 00:03:34,880
Really?

104
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:38,070
You kept sending me apartment listings.

105
00:03:39,530 --> 00:03:41,380
Um... well, I...

106
00:03:41,380 --> 00:03:43,530
yeah, you got me.

107
00:03:44,450 --> 00:03:45,400
Where are you moving?

108
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:48,740
And when? But a-also where?

109
00:03:48,740 --> 00:03:50,580
Bert has a room for rent.

110
00:03:50,580 --> 00:03:52,150
So you're gonna be roommates with Bert?

111
00:03:52,150 --> 00:03:54,700
Uh, no, it's, uh, pretty private, actually,

112
00:03:54,700 --> 00:03:55,890
it's over his garage.

113
00:03:55,890 --> 00:03:58,060
So the only time I'll see him is when he pulls his car in,

114
00:03:58,060 --> 00:04:02,640
does his laundry or practices drums in my dining room.

115
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:04,020
Well, good for you.

116
00:04:04,020 --> 00:04:05,570
I actually have a little news myself.

117
00:04:05,570 --> 00:04:07,980
Okay, we're just gonna circle back to when he's moving out?

118
00:04:07,980 --> 00:04:09,740
Okay, that's cool.

119
00:04:10,220 --> 00:04:13,390
I was, uh, asked to be a visiting researcher at Princeton.

120
00:04:13,390 --> 00:04:14,280
Hey, that's amazing.

121
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:15,080
- Good for you. - Congratulations.

122
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:17,030
Thanks, but the thing is I'll be gone for a few months

123
00:04:17,030 --> 00:04:19,320
and I don't know how Sheldon's gonna feel about that.

124
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:22,340
Oh, come on, he's a grown man, he can take care of himself.

125
00:04:22,340 --> 00:04:24,500
You really believe that?

126
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:28,850
Once again, you got me.

127
00:04:31,230 --> 00:04:33,640
How can you work on something for a year

128
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:34,650
and they just take it?

129
00:04:34,650 --> 00:04:36,970
I can't believe the Air Force would treat us like that.

130
00:04:36,970 --> 00:04:39,970
You know, I have a good mind to stop paying my taxes.

131
00:04:39,970 --> 00:04:43,180
It's too bad I enjoy doing them so much.

132
00:04:48,190 --> 00:04:50,290
The Air Force did it again.

133
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:53,960
They're erasing our lives!

134
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:57,140
Third floor, wrong apartment.

135
00:04:58,420 --> 00:05:00,390
Although, if anyone's gonna clean out your apartment

136
00:05:00,390 --> 00:05:03,360
and disappear, it'd be Penny.

137
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:04,630
She might disappear,

138
00:05:04,630 --> 00:05:07,870
but she's definitely not cleaning anything.

139
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:15,160
It's okay, everything's here.

140
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:16,820
Oh, hey, what's going on?

141
00:05:16,820 --> 00:05:17,600
You won't believe it;

142
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:19,860
the military confiscated our project.

143
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:21,010
- What? - You're kidding.

144
00:05:21,010 --> 00:05:22,010
Why would they do that?

145
00:05:22,010 --> 00:05:23,640
They wouldn't say.

146
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:25,260
I feel so betrayed.

147
00:05:25,260 --> 00:05:27,730
You know, all my life I thought Uncle Sam was a friendly uncle

148
00:05:27,730 --> 00:05:29,200
who brought you presents.

149
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:32,720
Turns out he's the other kind.

150
00:05:33,350 --> 00:05:34,680
Sheldon, I'm so sorry.

151
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:36,550
Thank you. Can we just talk about something else?

152
00:05:36,550 --> 00:05:38,260
Yeah, what's going on with you guys?

153
00:05:38,260 --> 00:05:39,900
Give us some good news.

154
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:42,450
Amy's got some news.

155
00:05:46,170 --> 00:05:48,350
Yeah, um...

156
00:05:48,870 --> 00:05:51,130
Raj is moving out.

157
00:05:52,470 --> 00:05:53,550
Oh, no.

158
00:05:53,550 --> 00:05:55,010
When?

159
00:05:59,260 --> 00:06:00,580
You doing okay?

160
00:06:00,580 --> 00:06:02,080
Not really.

161
00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:04,390
Want me to put on some Neil Diamond?

163
00:06:04,390 --> 00:06:07,050
That always makes you feel better.

164
00:06:07,050 --> 00:06:07,840
No.

165
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:12,380
Then you'll get all sexed up and I'm not in the mood.

166
00:06:12,630 --> 00:06:15,590
I mean, an entire year wasted.

167
00:06:15,590 --> 00:06:18,650
You might be forgetting another accomplishment of the past year.

168
00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:22,930
Yeah, yeah, we brought life into the world.

169
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:24,110
Really?

170
00:06:24,110 --> 00:06:26,330
That's the importance you put on us having a baby?

171
00:06:26,330 --> 00:06:29,190
I'm happy about it, but, I mean, it's not like I did much.

172
00:06:29,190 --> 00:06:30,430
I mean, after the first three minutes

173
00:06:30,430 --> 00:06:33,950
it was pretty much all you.

174
00:06:36,370 --> 00:06:38,530
So, did you tell him about Princeton yet?

175
00:06:38,530 --> 00:06:40,460
No, I'm waiting till he's in a good mood.

176
00:06:40,460 --> 00:06:43,820
Oh, sweetie, you might not live that long.

177
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:46,660
I don't know, maybe I shouldn't go.

178
00:06:46,660 --> 00:06:48,660
Oh, stop it, he'll be fine.

179
00:06:48,660 --> 00:06:49,560
I guess.

180
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:50,490
And he'll have you and Leonard

181
00:06:50,490 --> 00:06:52,570
right across the hall the whole time.

182
00:06:52,570 --> 00:06:55,040
Oh, damn, wait, you know, maybe you shouldn't go...

183
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:56,100
Got to go.

184
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:59,180
Morning.

185
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:03,920
I apologize for exceeding my allotted bathroom time.

186
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:04,970
Are you feeling okay?

187
00:07:04,970 --> 00:07:06,360
Not really.

188
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:11,500
Apparently grief can make one less regular.

189
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:13,270
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.

190
00:07:13,270 --> 00:07:17,180
No, I sat and I sat, but to no avail.

191
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:21,050
Oh, the-the more details, the more sorry.

192
00:07:21,990 --> 00:07:24,230
Well, maybe this'll cheer you up.

193
00:07:24,230 --> 00:07:26,380
I made your favorite oatmeal...

194
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:29,000
plain.

195
00:07:29,930 --> 00:07:31,820
What's the occasion?

196
00:07:31,820 --> 00:07:35,130
No occasion, I just wanted to do something nice for you.

197
00:07:35,130 --> 00:07:37,050
You're so kind.

198
00:07:37,050 --> 00:07:41,170
You know, I don't know how I ever got by without you.

199
00:07:42,390 --> 00:07:46,290
That's sweet, but you... you did just fine on your own.

200
00:07:46,290 --> 00:07:47,440
Well, I thought that, too,

201
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:52,130
but I've come to realize, I am completely dependent on you.

202
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:54,760
Sheldon, you're, you're being silly.

203
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:58,590
No, to wake up every morning and know you're there

204
00:07:58,590 --> 00:08:01,290
is a great comfort to me.

205
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:06,020
Mmm, tasteless.

206
00:08:08,980 --> 00:08:11,800
How do you do it?

207
00:08:12,410 --> 00:08:13,890
You know, what you need to do is

208
00:08:13,890 --> 00:08:15,810
put this Air Force project behind you

209
00:08:15,810 --> 00:08:18,230
and just dive into something new.

210
00:08:18,230 --> 00:08:21,390
Well, there is our quantum cognition experiment.

211
00:08:21,390 --> 00:08:24,050
You and I could spend more time on that.

212
00:08:24,050 --> 00:08:25,760
Oh, I don't know,

213
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:28,080
I mean, let's say we succeed in proving

214
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:29,790
that our consciousness creates reality.

215
00:08:29,790 --> 00:08:31,450
I mean, what will we have really accomplished?

216
00:08:31,450 --> 00:08:34,290
You know, a loaf of bread's still three bucks.

217
00:08:35,530 --> 00:08:37,060
I'm confused.

218
00:08:37,060 --> 00:08:39,640
You're always saying that you want to spend more time with me.

219
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:41,520
That is true, I have said that.

220
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:44,810
Well, a lot, it's very annoying.

221
00:08:45,780 --> 00:08:47,540
Has something changed?

222
00:08:47,540 --> 00:08:51,160
Um, is there something that you're not telling me?

223
00:08:52,940 --> 00:08:56,840
I was offered a summer research fellowship at Princeton.

224
00:08:59,010 --> 00:09:01,010
Princeton?

225
00:09:01,010 --> 00:09:03,780
A fine institution.

226
00:09:03,780 --> 00:09:06,460
The place where Albert Einstein taught.

227
00:09:06,460 --> 00:09:08,590
And where Leonard got his PhD,

228
00:09:08,590 --> 00:09:11,560
so it may have gone downhill.

229
00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:15,490
Yeah, that's the one.

230
00:09:15,490 --> 00:09:17,880
Well, that's wonderful.

231
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:19,200
Congratulations.

232
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:20,610
Well, I-I haven't accepted it yet.

233
00:09:20,610 --> 00:09:22,560
I wanted to talk to you first.

234
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:23,710
Wh-What is there to talk about?

235
00:09:23,710 --> 00:09:26,050
You have to take it. It's important.

236
00:09:26,050 --> 00:09:27,000
So are you.

237
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,550
Thank you, but I'll be fine.

238
00:09:28,550 --> 00:09:30,040
Are-are you sure?

239
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:34,440
Yes. I may have lost my guidance system and my girlfriend,

240
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:36,270
but I still have a colon full of yesterday's meals

241
00:09:36,270 --> 00:09:38,610
to keep me company.

242
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:42,790
Although, thanks to your high-fiber breakfast,

243
00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:45,290
I'm sure that'll be leaving me, too.

244
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:50,220
Really?

245
00:09:50,220 --> 00:09:54,560
He doesn't put raisins or banana slices or anything in it?

246
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:58,330
I don't think plain oatmeal was the point of that story.

247
00:09:58,330 --> 00:09:59,740
I mean, I like a little brown sugar...

248
00:09:59,740 --> 00:10:00,910
Guys.

249
00:10:00,930 --> 00:10:03,180
- Sorry. - Sorry.

250
00:10:03,180 --> 00:10:04,840
You're still gonna go, right?

251
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:05,570
I don't know.

252
00:10:05,570 --> 00:10:07,420
Sheldon's so vulnerable right now.

253
00:10:07,420 --> 00:10:09,460
Oh, come on. Look, if the roles were reversed,

254
00:10:09,460 --> 00:10:11,360
he'd be on the first train to New Jersey,

255
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:15,430
or the second train if there were teenagers on the first one.

256
00:10:15,430 --> 00:10:17,540
Well, distance might be nice.

257
00:10:17,540 --> 00:10:19,690
The last time a big project ended for Howie,

258
00:10:19,690 --> 00:10:21,450
he wouldn't stop following me around.

259
00:10:21,450 --> 00:10:23,600
He even went with me to get a mammogram.

260
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:24,730
Well, what's wrong with that?

261
00:10:24,730 --> 00:10:26,660
No, he wanted to get one with me,

262
00:10:26,660 --> 00:10:30,370
like some kind of weird couple's massage.

263
00:10:30,670 --> 00:10:33,970
And yet you bore his child. Neato.

264
00:10:34,990 --> 00:10:37,610
You're excited about this opportunity, right?

265
00:10:37,610 --> 00:10:39,760
Of course. I get to be part of the first team

266
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:42,150
to use radon markers to map the structures that...

267
00:10:42,150 --> 00:10:45,210
Okay, a simple yes will do.

268
00:10:45,210 --> 00:10:46,690
You have to go.

269
00:10:46,690 --> 00:10:48,400
I know, but what if Sheldon...

270
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:50,250
Okay, listen to me. Your relationship can handle

271
00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:51,640
being long distance for a while.

272
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:53,690
It's not like you two are very physical.

273
00:10:53,690 --> 00:10:55,930
Hey, you don't know what goes on behind closed doors.

274
00:10:55,930 --> 00:10:57,030
A lot of lectures?

275
00:10:57,030 --> 00:10:59,720
All right, so you know.

276
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:01,390
I'm telling you, if you don't go

277
00:11:01,390 --> 00:11:02,860
you'll end up regretting it.

278
00:11:03,710 --> 00:11:06,750
- Wait up! ?- Oh, great.

279
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:09,840
You left something at home.

280
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:10,870
A big hug!

281
00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:15,710
I found it right next to these kisses.

282
00:11:17,580 --> 00:11:18,460
It's too late for me.

283
00:11:18,460 --> 00:11:20,770
Save yourself.

284
00:11:23,020 --> 00:11:25,120
So, are you excited to have your own place again?

285
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:27,560
I am, but I'll miss you guys.

286
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:29,080
Ah, we'll miss you, too.

287
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:32,850
Wha... you could try saying that without smiling.

288
00:11:32,850 --> 00:11:36,110
I'm trying. This is the best I can do.

289
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:47,530
What are you doing?

290
00:11:47,530 --> 00:11:49,190
What does it look like?

291
00:11:49,190 --> 00:11:51,870
I'm playing sad harmonica...

292
00:11:51,870 --> 00:11:55,510
in an apartment as empty as my heart.

293
00:11:56,020 --> 00:11:57,180
Why?

294
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:59,840
I got the blues.

295
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:02,330
My baby done left me.

296
00:12:02,910 --> 00:12:04,890
Come on, Sheldon.

297
00:12:04,890 --> 00:12:07,000
Amy's only gone for a few months.

298
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,400
And now that I'm moving out, your old room is empty,

299
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:11,520
so you can stay there whenever you want.

300
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:13,530
Uh, could I talk to you in the hall for a sec?

301
00:12:13,530 --> 00:12:14,980
Yeah, sure.

302
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:23,280
Sheldon, you're being silly.

303
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:24,440
Am I?

304
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:26,180
Yesterday I had an Air Force project,

305
00:12:26,180 --> 00:12:27,750
a girlfriend who lived with me,

306
00:12:27,750 --> 00:12:30,820
and my good friend Raj right across the hall.

307
00:12:30,820 --> 00:12:33,490
Do you really care about that last one?

308
00:12:33,490 --> 00:12:36,670
No, but that list was sounding a little thin.

309
00:12:36,670 --> 00:12:40,280
Instead of dwelling on the negative, think about this.

310
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:42,980
Your girlfriend was given an amazing opportunity,

311
00:12:42,980 --> 00:12:44,790
which gives you an opportunity

312
00:12:44,790 --> 00:12:49,280
to show her that you're a loving and supportive boyfriend.

313
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:52,370
So trick her.

314
00:12:54,350 --> 00:12:55,990
All right, let me start again.

315
00:12:55,990 --> 00:12:57,850
Uh... you and Amy...

316
00:12:57,850 --> 00:12:59,220
Can I get my stuff?

317
00:12:59,220 --> 00:13:02,790
Sounds like it's gonna be a while.

318
00:13:09,010 --> 00:13:09,940
I missed you.

319
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:13,910
Come here, let's talk.

320
00:13:13,910 --> 00:13:16,020
Ooh. Sounds serious.

321
00:13:16,020 --> 00:13:17,470
Have I been a bad boy?

322
00:13:17,470 --> 00:13:18,340
Am I gonna get a spanking

323
00:13:18,340 --> 00:13:20,940
- 'cause you know I... - Just listen.

324
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:23,400
I don't know if you realize this,

325
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:26,230
but whenever you're between projects,

326
00:13:26,230 --> 00:13:29,070
you tend to get a little insecure.

327
00:13:29,070 --> 00:13:30,690
A little clingy.

328
00:13:30,690 --> 00:13:32,930
I know and I'm sorry.

329
00:13:32,930 --> 00:13:34,800
Oh, oh, oh, okay, stop.

330
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:35,970
Stop.

331
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:39,340
I love when you're affectionate,

332
00:13:39,340 --> 00:13:41,930
but this is not coming from a good place.

333
00:13:41,930 --> 00:13:43,430
Well, excuse me,

334
00:13:43,430 --> 00:13:46,070
but what did you do when you worked on that allergy drug

335
00:13:46,070 --> 00:13:49,900
for two years and the FDA shut down your project?

336
00:13:49,900 --> 00:13:53,870
I signed us up for ballroom dance class.

337
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:56,240
Okay, and what did you do

338
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:59,920
when they took you off the antifungal team?

339
00:14:00,490 --> 00:14:03,350
I made us have a baby.

340
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:06,920
So?

341
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:08,940
Bring it in.

342
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:14,480
And now the movie just got rated "R."

343
00:14:19,410 --> 00:14:21,090
You going somewhere?

344
00:14:21,090 --> 00:14:22,800
No, but you are,

345
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:26,360
so I got you this as a present.

346
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:28,410
Sheldon, that isn't necessary.

347
00:14:28,410 --> 00:14:29,450
No, it is.

348
00:14:29,450 --> 00:14:30,640
Leonard pointed out to me

349
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:34,060
that I'm not always a loving and supportive boyfriend,

350
00:14:34,060 --> 00:14:37,890
so here's some quality luggage.

351
00:14:38,950 --> 00:14:40,360
Thank you.

352
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:44,340
The salesman said it could survive a plane crash, so...

353
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:49,520
Perhaps you should fly inside it.

354
00:14:52,950 --> 00:14:55,490
Does this mean you're okay with me going?

355
00:14:55,490 --> 00:14:57,340
Well, I'm not looking forward to it,

356
00:14:57,340 --> 00:14:59,700
but it is a wonderful opportunity

357
00:14:59,700 --> 00:15:01,470
and you need to take it.

358
00:15:01,470 --> 00:15:03,650
Besides, Princeton is in New Jersey,

359
00:15:03,650 --> 00:15:07,920
so it's not like you're gonna want to stay.

360
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:15,630
Uh, I know it's not your birthday,

361
00:15:15,630 --> 00:15:16,570
but if you're interested...

362
00:15:16,570 --> 00:15:18,340
- I am. - Okay.

363
00:15:20,340 --> 00:15:22,800
Oh, and just to be clear,

364
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:26,530
I'm not being intimate with you in order to keep you from going.

365
00:15:26,530 --> 00:15:27,910
I wasn't thinking that.

366
00:15:27,910 --> 00:15:30,300
Well, no, it's just, I'm just warning you, you know,

367
00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:32,800
if you find yourself 3,000 miles away

368
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:36,300
and craving a-a hit of this, you know...

369
00:15:37,450 --> 00:15:40,830
...I can't Skype it to you.

370
00:15:41,590 --> 00:15:44,360
That's a risk I'm willing to take.

371
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:46,030
All right, then.

372
00:15:46,030 --> 00:15:49,930
Let's go to the bedroom, remove our clothes,

373
00:15:49,930 --> 00:15:52,450
fold them neatly...

374
00:15:53,220 --> 00:15:58,440
...and engage in frenzied lovemaking.

375
00:15:59,390 --> 00:16:01,740
What if we don't fold our clothes at all?

376
00:16:01,740 --> 00:16:03,620
I'd... or...

377
00:16:04,170 --> 00:16:07,120
what if we fold them?

378
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:10,800
Well, here's your key back.

379
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:11,450
Thank you.

380
00:16:11,450 --> 00:16:13,650
As soon as I have the place set up I'm gonna have you guys over.

381
00:16:13,650 --> 00:16:15,280
Oh, we would love that.

382
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:17,500
I really can't thank you enough for taking me in.

383
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:20,490
You know, I was in a pretty low place in my life, and...

384
00:16:20,490 --> 00:16:23,410
Oh, Amy, you naughty vixen.

385
00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:31,690
Anyway, uh, as I was saying,

386
00:16:31,690 --> 00:16:34,550
I was at a pretty low place in my life and, uh,

387
00:16:34,550 --> 00:16:35,920
if it wasn't for friends like you...

388
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:37,670
My goodness, that form of stimulation

389
00:16:37,670 --> 00:16:39,820
is highly efficient.

390
00:16:44,060 --> 00:16:46,990
I can't compete with that. Bye.

391
00:16:48,550 --> 00:16:49,960
Should we give them their privacy?

392
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:53,360
I want to, but I don't think I can.

393
00:16:54,060 --> 00:16:57,020
- Whoopee! - Okay, I'm good now.

394
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:03,810
Okay, the car is waiting.

395
00:17:03,810 --> 00:17:05,740
Do you want to walk me downstairs?

396
00:17:05,740 --> 00:17:06,460
Of course.

397
00:17:06,460 --> 00:17:07,970
Here, here, let me.

398
00:17:07,970 --> 00:17:10,550
I've been doing a little research on New Jersey,

399
00:17:10,550 --> 00:17:12,210
and I was delighted to learn

400
00:17:12,210 --> 00:17:16,320
that their chief agricultural product is sod.

401
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:18,720
- Is it? - Hmm, yes.

402
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:22,920
Yeah, perhaps I've been harder on them than they deserve.

403
00:17:24,630 --> 00:17:25,820
Do you think it's possible

404
00:17:25,820 --> 00:17:29,590
you might enjoy being on your own for a little while?

405
00:17:29,590 --> 00:17:30,660
It's hard to say.

406
00:17:30,660 --> 00:17:32,730
I've never really lived by myself.

407
00:17:32,730 --> 00:17:36,680
What if I become strange and eccentric?

408
00:17:41,010 --> 00:17:43,750
I'll love you no matter what.

409
00:17:44,890 --> 00:17:48,830
Howard Hughes saved his urine in milk bottles.

411
00:17:49,780 --> 00:17:52,640
We'll cross that bridge when we come to it.

412
00:17:54,150 --> 00:17:56,790
- And you'll text me when you arrive at the airport? - I will.

413
00:17:56,790 --> 00:17:57,880
And when you're at the gate?

414
00:17:58,470 --> 00:18:02,060
And if you see any actors from Game of Thrones in first class?

415
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:05,280
I don't know what they look like, but sure.

416
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:07,590
- And don't forget to Skype me when you arrive. - I won't.

417
00:18:07,590 --> 00:18:08,950
- And every morning. - Got it.

418
00:18:08,950 --> 00:18:11,220
Now of course, my 9:00 A.M. is your noon,

419
00:18:11,220 --> 00:18:12,650
so let's avoid the whole "Good morning,"

420
00:18:12,650 --> 00:18:13,660
"Good afternoon" minefield,

421
00:18:13,660 --> 00:18:15,860
and let's just say, "Hello."

422
00:18:16,580 --> 00:18:17,690
Good thinking.

423
00:18:17,690 --> 00:18:19,770
And just remember, I am proud of you

424
00:18:19,770 --> 00:18:22,830
and I support you in all that you do.

425
00:18:22,830 --> 00:18:24,330
Thank you. That means a lot.

426
00:18:24,330 --> 00:18:25,470
Oh, and one last thing.

427
00:18:25,470 --> 00:18:28,330
If you find yourself working with a male scientist

428
00:18:28,330 --> 00:18:31,000
who's as smart as me, as tall as me

429
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,720
and has hair like Thor,

430
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:34,930
well, then I want you to step away from the situation

431
00:18:34,930 --> 00:18:37,290
and call me immediately.
