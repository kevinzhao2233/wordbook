1
00:00:03,710 --> 00:00:05,710
How much will it hurt?

2
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:07,770
It's just a tiny skin sample.

3
00:00:07,770 --> 00:00:09,800
You saw me do it to myself.

4
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:11,290
On a scale of one to ten,

5
00:00:11,290 --> 00:00:13,390
where one is a pebble in your shoe

6
00:00:13,390 --> 00:00:15,740
and ten is the monkey you thought

7
00:00:15,740 --> 00:00:18,410
was your pet biting your face off.

8
00:00:18,950 --> 00:00:19,790
A two.

9
00:00:19,790 --> 00:00:22,330
Eating a whole Altoid?

10
00:00:23,810 --> 00:00:26,030
Sheldon, if I'm gonna synthesize a neural network

11
00:00:26,030 --> 00:00:28,470
from our skin cells, I need to harvest them.

12
00:00:28,470 --> 00:00:30,020
Now, I've done this dozens of times,

13
00:00:30,020 --> 00:00:32,110
but if you're too scared you don't have to.

14
00:00:32,110 --> 00:00:34,080
No, this is for science.

15
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:36,190
I can be brave for science.

16
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:39,100
Thank you.

17
00:00:39,340 --> 00:00:41,370
Oh, jiminy, that's cold!

18
00:00:41,740 --> 00:00:43,510
Just think how happy you'll be in a few weeks

19
00:00:43,510 --> 00:00:44,790
when I've converted our skin cells

20
00:00:44,790 --> 00:00:47,210
into functional brain cells.

21
00:00:47,210 --> 00:00:50,400
All right, just warn me before you do it.

22
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:51,940
Okay.

23
00:00:52,670 --> 00:00:53,970
Three...

24
00:00:54,660 --> 00:00:56,820
two... and we're done.

25
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:00,540
You tricked me.

26
00:01:00,540 --> 00:01:02,000
You didn't say one.

27
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,160
- It didn't hurt, did it? - No...

28
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:06,320
but "Three, two and we're done" is incomplete.

29
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:08,340
You know those things bother me.

30
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:09,990
It's like hearing "Da-da-da-da-da-dah"

31
00:01:09,990 --> 00:01:10,750
without yelling...

32
00:01:10,750 --> 00:01:12,460
Okay, fine, one.

33
00:01:12,460 --> 00:01:14,130
Thank you.

34
00:01:14,130 --> 00:01:17,060
Now yell "Charge" and we can get out of here.

35
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:47,880
Oh, my God, I just got it.

36
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:49,810
Fun onions...

37
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:52,060
Funyuns.

38
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:56,470
Hold on.

39
00:01:57,210 --> 00:01:58,800
Is that a wobble?

40
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:00,110
Yes.

41
00:02:00,110 --> 00:02:02,510
That's definitely a gravitational wobble.

42
00:02:02,510 --> 00:02:04,440
Uh, sorry, I could come back.

43
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:05,260
Oh, no, it's okay.

44
00:02:05,260 --> 00:02:07,090
I-I just found a wobble.

45
00:02:07,090 --> 00:02:09,720
Oh, do I need a mop?

46
00:02:10,310 --> 00:02:12,210
It's a gravitational wobble.

47
00:02:12,210 --> 00:02:13,990
It could be a sign of an extrasolar planet

48
00:02:13,990 --> 00:02:16,680
that may contain life and someday be named after me.

49
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:18,920
Oh... well, if it has life,

50
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:20,710
maybe it already has a name, huh?

51
00:02:20,710 --> 00:02:22,850
Yeah, but it's probably difficult to pronounce.

52
00:02:22,850 --> 00:02:24,020
What is your name?

53
00:02:24,020 --> 00:02:27,010
Rajesh Ramayan Koothrappali.

54
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:30,600
You think it would be more difficult than that?

55
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:32,530
Good point.

56
00:02:32,650 --> 00:02:33,420
And you are?

57
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:36,320
Oh, uh, Issabella Maria Concepcion.

58
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:37,510
Oh, well, nice to meet you.

59
00:02:37,510 --> 00:02:39,200
Nice to meet you, too.

60
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:40,210
You know, I have to say,

61
00:02:40,210 --> 00:02:41,540
based on the candy wrappers

62
00:02:41,540 --> 00:02:43,900
and the bags of junk food I see in this trash,

63
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:47,350
I thought the person working here was ten years old.

64
00:02:47,350 --> 00:02:49,310
Oh, please, show me a ten-year-old who knows

65
00:02:49,310 --> 00:02:52,200
to dip Tootsie Rolls in Nutella.

66
00:02:52,890 --> 00:02:55,230
Bueno, um, I'm just going to empty your waste paper basket

67
00:02:55,230 --> 00:02:56,410
and then I'll get out of your way.

68
00:02:56,410 --> 00:02:57,830
Oh, please, allow me.

69
00:03:00,860 --> 00:03:03,730
That's a lot of empty calories.

70
00:03:04,290 --> 00:03:05,250
Thank you.

71
00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:06,710
You're welcome.

72
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:13,580
Okay, uh, okay, I-I-I have to go.

73
00:03:13,580 --> 00:03:16,800
Good luck with your, um, space exploration.

74
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:17,750
Thank you.

75
00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:18,990
Good luck with your...

76
00:03:20,150 --> 00:03:22,410
future endeavors.

77
00:03:25,690 --> 00:03:26,520
Did it work?

78
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:28,160
Are they brain cells yet?

79
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:29,950
If you'd give me a minute, I'll tell you.

80
00:03:29,950 --> 00:03:31,490
Oh, just let me look.

81
00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:34,710
Oh, my goodness!

82
00:03:34,710 --> 00:03:36,840
I see quivering black lines.

83
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:38,420
Those must be neurons.

84
00:03:38,420 --> 00:03:40,860
Oh, they're so thick and beautiful.

85
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:43,430
Those are your eyelashes, move.

86
00:03:46,770 --> 00:03:48,130
Well, Sheldon...

87
00:03:48,130 --> 00:03:51,310
I see astrocytes.

88
00:03:51,310 --> 00:03:54,930
Our combined skin cells are now a primitive neural network.

89
00:03:56,760 --> 00:04:00,790
I have such a profound sense of creation.

90
00:04:00,790 --> 00:04:03,870
I ju... it's like when I hatched Sea-Monkeys,

91
00:04:03,870 --> 00:04:05,430
except that this is from my DNA,

92
00:04:05,430 --> 00:04:06,810
so this is like...

93
00:04:06,810 --> 00:04:08,360
Me-Monkeys.

94
00:04:10,220 --> 00:04:11,890
These cells come from both of us.

95
00:04:11,890 --> 00:04:14,320
Yeah, but Us-Monkeys doesn't pop.

96
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:16,110
Oh, oh, oh, oh, wait!

97
00:04:16,110 --> 00:04:18,290
We-Monkeys, there you go.

98
00:04:18,870 --> 00:04:20,730
When can we start running tests on it?

99
00:04:20,730 --> 00:04:22,610
No reason we can't start right now.

100
00:04:22,610 --> 00:04:24,670
What stimulus should we introduce it to first?

101
00:04:24,670 --> 00:04:26,550
L-Light, sound, temperature...

102
00:04:27,260 --> 00:04:29,650
Let's expose it to images of me and you

103
00:04:29,650 --> 00:04:31,860
and see who it likes better.

104
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:34,650
Sheldon, this is a rudimentary collection of neurons.

105
00:04:34,650 --> 00:04:35,410
I mean, it's remarkable,

106
00:04:35,410 --> 00:04:37,190
but it's still limited in what it can do.

107
00:04:37,190 --> 00:04:38,480
I understand.

108
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:41,210
She's the mean one, I'm the fun one.

109
00:04:44,530 --> 00:04:47,690
Huh, they screwed up and gave us steamed broccoli.

110
00:04:47,690 --> 00:04:48,890
Oh, no, that's mine.

111
00:04:48,890 --> 00:04:49,550
Really?

112
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:52,390
The last green thing I saw you eat was a Skittle.

113
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:55,630
Well, I can't eat like a ten-year-old all the time.

114
00:04:55,630 --> 00:04:57,750
You're dating somebody, who is it?

115
00:04:58,300 --> 00:04:58,820
What?

116
00:04:58,820 --> 00:04:59,860
What are you talking about?

117
00:04:59,860 --> 00:05:01,430
You only watch what you eat when you're afraid

118
00:05:01,430 --> 00:05:03,830
you might have to take your shirt off.

119
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:05,900
No, she's right.

120
00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:07,140
As long as I've known you,

121
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:10,570
you've always been self-conscious about your cleavage.

122
00:05:11,050 --> 00:05:14,010
It's because you keep trying to stick pencils in it.

123
00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:17,870
All right, fine, don't tell us.

124
00:05:17,870 --> 00:05:19,360
- There's nothing to tell. - All right.

125
00:05:26,030 --> 00:05:27,110
How's that broccoli?

126
00:05:27,110 --> 00:05:29,150
It's gross but I have to eat it because I met somebody.

127
00:05:29,150 --> 00:05:29,820
Bam.

128
00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:31,070
Thank you.

129
00:05:31,070 --> 00:05:31,830
What's her name?

130
00:05:31,830 --> 00:05:32,700
Issabella.

131
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:35,480
Oh, did you meet her at work?

132
00:05:35,810 --> 00:05:38,000
Yes, in the telescope room.

133
00:05:38,180 --> 00:05:40,290
Oh, so she's an astronomer?

134
00:05:40,290 --> 00:05:41,960
Yes...

135
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:44,830
which is why she was in the telescope room.

136
00:05:44,830 --> 00:05:46,480
Yes, this is all making sense. Good.

137
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:47,990
Well, that's great, Raj.

138
00:05:47,990 --> 00:05:49,580
You must have so much in common.

139
00:05:50,590 --> 00:05:52,090
So, when do we meet her?

140
00:05:52,090 --> 00:05:53,860
No, no, this is brand-new.

141
00:05:53,860 --> 00:05:56,200
We haven't even been on a proper date yet.

142
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:59,120
- Okay, well, good luck with it. - Thank you.

143
00:06:00,050 --> 00:06:02,690
How come you never eat broccoli?

144
00:06:03,310 --> 00:06:03,930
I'm married,

145
00:06:03,930 --> 00:06:06,120
I don't have to be attractive.

146
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:12,130
You know, most people don't realize this technique

147
00:06:12,130 --> 00:06:14,000
has actually been around for a few years.

148
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,710
Still, I can't believe you can turn ordinary skin cells

149
00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:18,550
into functioning brain cells.

150
00:06:18,550 --> 00:06:20,560
Well, I turned this one into a functioning boyfriend,

151
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:22,420
so sky's the limit.

152
00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:26,270
Look, look... here I am

153
00:06:26,270 --> 00:06:28,800
standing next to the incubator.

154
00:06:29,540 --> 00:06:33,860
Uh, here is a microscopic view of the cells.

155
00:06:34,330 --> 00:06:36,490
Look at that, put them in a tiny Flash T-shirt

156
00:06:36,490 --> 00:06:38,070
and it's you.

157
00:06:38,990 --> 00:06:41,570
Yeah, this little guy can already recognize

158
00:06:41,570 --> 00:06:43,320
electronically transmitted images

159
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:47,620
20% faster than any other sample in Amy's lab.

160
00:06:47,620 --> 00:06:50,300
I'm running out of ways to act excited.

161
00:06:51,950 --> 00:06:54,920
So, enough about us, how are things going with you?

162
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:57,830
Great, the doctor said the baby's head is facing down now.

163
00:06:57,830 --> 00:06:59,220
Good, you know,

164
00:06:59,220 --> 00:07:01,780
in case the exit isn't clearly marked.

165
00:07:02,490 --> 00:07:05,560
Yeah, I have to say, it is nice to share

166
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:09,140
this experience with someone who's on the same journey.

167
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:13,410
Although right now ours is testing off the charts

168
00:07:13,410 --> 00:07:16,720
while yours is floating around in its own waste.

169
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:20,740
Are you actually comparing my human baby

170
00:07:20,740 --> 00:07:23,360
to your brain in a bowl?

171
00:07:24,530 --> 00:07:25,770
Well, I didn't make you waddle up

172
00:07:25,770 --> 00:07:28,360
four flights of stairs for the heck of it.

173
00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:32,190
You do realize my baby has functioning organs

174
00:07:32,190 --> 00:07:33,750
and can recognize voices.

175
00:07:33,750 --> 00:07:36,790
Yeah, but ours can recognize a specific data stream

176
00:07:36,790 --> 00:07:39,470
among background noise.

177
00:07:39,470 --> 00:07:42,160
Mine has a fully developed immune system.

178
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:43,770
Ours doesn't need an immune system

179
00:07:43,770 --> 00:07:47,110
because it lives in a state-of-the-art German incubator.

180
00:07:47,110 --> 00:07:48,310
Sheldon, that's enough.

181
00:07:48,310 --> 00:07:49,750
Oh, yeah, no, fine.

182
00:07:49,750 --> 00:07:51,630
Let's just agree that both creations

183
00:07:51,630 --> 00:07:53,170
are special in their own way

184
00:07:53,170 --> 00:07:55,610
and it is foolish to try and compare them.

185
00:07:55,610 --> 00:07:57,770
Although, we didn't need to have sex with Howard for ours,

186
00:07:57,770 --> 00:07:59,210
so we win.

187
00:08:03,190 --> 00:08:04,620
This is fun.

188
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:09,610
I have never cleaned a toilet before.

189
00:08:09,610 --> 00:08:10,720
You're kidding.

190
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:12,410
No, I grew up with a house full of servants

191
00:08:12,410 --> 00:08:14,230
and now I have a cleaning lady...

192
00:08:14,230 --> 00:08:15,750
...who is a lovely woman

193
00:08:15,750 --> 00:08:18,030
who I have great respect for.

194
00:08:18,790 --> 00:08:21,460
It's okay, you're allowed to have a cleaning lady.

195
00:08:21,460 --> 00:08:23,230
Oh, good, because she also walks my dog,

196
00:08:23,230 --> 00:08:25,890
buys my groceries and cuts my hair.

197
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:29,110
I think that's called a mommy.

198
00:08:32,030 --> 00:08:33,570
So, forgive me...

199
00:08:33,570 --> 00:08:34,660
forgive me for being nosy,

200
00:08:34,660 --> 00:08:36,290
but is-is there a wedding ring

201
00:08:36,290 --> 00:08:38,440
under those pretty rubber gloves?

202
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:42,670
No, not for many years.

203
00:08:42,670 --> 00:08:44,400
Oh, so, you are unencumbered?

204
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:45,790
Just me and my son.

205
00:08:45,790 --> 00:08:47,950
I love kids, how old is he?

206
00:08:47,950 --> 00:08:49,610
Nineteen.

207
00:08:50,790 --> 00:08:52,600
That's a cute age.

208
00:08:53,590 --> 00:08:56,240
They can do so many things.

209
00:08:57,020 --> 00:09:00,070
He's studying to be a lawyer at UCLA.

210
00:09:00,070 --> 00:09:00,820
That's wonderful.

211
00:09:00,820 --> 00:09:02,900
A lawyer, my sister's a lawyer.

212
00:09:02,900 --> 00:09:05,740
Look at that, we have something in common.

213
00:09:05,740 --> 00:09:07,940
Yeah, I guess we do.

214
00:09:07,940 --> 00:09:10,520
Maybe there are other things we have in common.

215
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:13,930
C-Come dinnertime, do you enjoy eating food?

216
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:16,970
Ay, Rajesh,

217
00:09:16,970 --> 00:09:18,970
I think you're very sweet, but

218
00:09:19,310 --> 00:09:22,570
I work two jobs and I don't have time for dating.

219
00:09:22,570 --> 00:09:24,150
Yeah, sure. I understand.

220
00:09:24,150 --> 00:09:25,770
Yeah, I'm very busy, too.

221
00:09:25,770 --> 00:09:27,350
Oh, please don't take it personal,

222
00:09:27,350 --> 00:09:29,880
I think you're a very nice man.

223
00:09:30,190 --> 00:09:32,530
I think you're very nice as well.

224
00:09:32,530 --> 00:09:34,510
Thank you for helping me.

225
00:09:34,510 --> 00:09:36,050
Good night, Rajesh.

226
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:37,940
Oh, yes. Oh, okay.

227
00:09:39,570 --> 00:09:40,900
Good night.

228
00:09:46,170 --> 00:09:46,790
I don't know,

229
00:09:46,790 --> 00:09:49,950
maybe it's the fumes from the urinal cakes,

230
00:09:49,950 --> 00:09:53,670
but I feel like something is happening between us.

231
00:09:53,670 --> 00:09:55,900
Good night, Rajesh.

232
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:57,840
Okay. I'll leave.

233
00:09:57,840 --> 00:10:00,220
But just know, every time I come in here,

234
00:10:00,220 --> 00:10:02,890
I'll be thinking of you.

235
00:10:08,420 --> 00:10:09,600
Would you look at that?

236
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:12,440
The image we gave it was 45% white noise,

237
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:14,470
and it still managed to reconstruct it.

238
00:10:14,470 --> 00:10:16,140
I've never seen results like this before.

239
00:10:16,140 --> 00:10:18,460
Yeah, we need to stop for magnets on the way home;

240
00:10:18,460 --> 00:10:20,740
this is going right on the fridge.

241
00:10:21,260 --> 00:10:23,000
Aren't you glad you participated in this?

242
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,090
Oh, I am.

243
00:10:24,090 --> 00:10:26,740
And you realize what the next step is?

244
00:10:27,010 --> 00:10:28,280
Set up a second culture

245
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:30,290
and try to replicate our results.

246
00:10:30,290 --> 00:10:31,920
Uh, no.

247
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:33,440
We lock that door,

248
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:36,800
lower our underpants a little and make a baby.

249
00:10:44,450 --> 00:10:47,450
Make a baby? What are you talking about?

250
00:10:47,450 --> 00:10:50,660
Clearly the combination of our DNA is exceptional.

251
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:54,690
Our child could be the next step in the evolution of mankind.

252
00:10:54,690 --> 00:10:57,720
We... we'll be able to get into any preschool we want!

253
00:10:58,220 --> 00:11:00,420
Sh-Sheldon, I'm not ready to have a baby.

254
00:11:00,420 --> 00:11:03,640
Oh, yes, you are! I track your cycle.

255
00:11:04,170 --> 00:11:06,250
For the next 36 hours you're as fertile

256
00:11:06,250 --> 00:11:08,940
as a manure-covered wheat field.

257
00:11:11,090 --> 00:11:13,020
Wow. I-I can actually feel

258
00:11:13,020 --> 00:11:15,920
the egg crawling its way back up.

259
00:11:17,430 --> 00:11:18,960
I don't understand.

260
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:21,510
I thought you'd be thrilled to procreate with me.

261
00:11:21,510 --> 00:11:22,730
Not right now.

262
00:11:22,730 --> 00:11:25,330
Oh, I see what's happening here.

263
00:11:25,330 --> 00:11:27,710
You're playing hard to get.

264
00:11:28,870 --> 00:11:30,490
I'm not playing anything.

265
00:11:30,490 --> 00:11:32,920
We're not making a baby today.

266
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:34,800
Very well.

267
00:11:37,390 --> 00:11:39,040
Oops, how clumsy of me.

268
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:41,500
You know what? Let me get that.

269
00:11:52,650 --> 00:11:53,830
Where are you going?

270
00:11:53,830 --> 00:11:54,520
I...

271
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:57,550
Did you even look at my bottom?

272
00:12:02,370 --> 00:12:04,550
Welcome.

273
00:12:06,110 --> 00:12:07,440
What is this?

274
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:09,730
Oh, well, you said you didn't have time to go out for dinner,

275
00:12:09,730 --> 00:12:12,360
so I thought we could have one right here.

276
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:14,020
- Oh, Rajesh... - Oh, come on!

277
00:12:14,020 --> 00:12:15,560
We're in the telescope room!

278
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:18,140
It'll be like dining under the stars.

279
00:12:18,140 --> 00:12:19,970
Y-You see this, uh, double zero?

280
00:12:19,970 --> 00:12:23,700
When it says "01," That means it's twinkling.

281
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:31,390
Sometimes it takes a while.

282
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:34,570
Rajesh, this is so sweet,

283
00:12:34,570 --> 00:12:36,130
but you... you know I'm working.

284
00:12:36,130 --> 00:12:38,070
That's why I already cleaned up in here

285
00:12:38,070 --> 00:12:40,640
and all the other rooms in the hall.

286
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:45,300
Well, I suppose that gives me a little time.

287
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:46,840
Oh, please sit!

288
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:50,370
I tried to cook you a meal from your homeland.

289
00:12:50,370 --> 00:12:51,540
Oh, really?

290
00:12:51,540 --> 00:12:53,790
You made Cuban food?

291
00:12:54,710 --> 00:12:58,520
That depends-- do they have Mexican food in Cuba?

292
00:13:01,550 --> 00:13:03,940
Now, when he said "Make a baby""

293
00:13:03,940 --> 00:13:07,690
is it possible he meant out of Legos?

294
00:13:08,140 --> 00:13:10,040
No. He was explicit.

295
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:13,450
Needlessly and freakishly explicit.

296
00:13:14,490 --> 00:13:16,120
Why does he need a baby?

297
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:19,960
He's already hairless and smells like talcum powder.

298
00:13:20,740 --> 00:13:22,310
Could you two really have some sort of

299
00:13:22,310 --> 00:13:24,200
super-intelligent child?

300
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:25,880
Well, there is a genetic component,

301
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:27,650
but that doesn't guarantee anything.

302
00:13:27,650 --> 00:13:28,930
That's true. Sheldon's father

303
00:13:28,930 --> 00:13:31,380
once picked a fight with a cactus.

304
00:13:32,210 --> 00:13:33,800
Yeah, but that's just his Earth parents.

305
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:36,720
We don't know anything about the ones that sent him here.

306
00:13:39,010 --> 00:13:42,420
Well, we know they were smart enough to send him away.

307
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:45,500
Hey, you're talking about the person I love

308
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:48,800
and have been avoiding for the past three hours.

309
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:51,700
Aw, man.

310
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:56,590
Sheldon gonna get some.

311
00:13:57,280 --> 00:13:59,380
Well, have fun with whatever nightmare's

312
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:01,620
behind door number two.

313
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:20,820
Well, hello.

314
00:14:22,490 --> 00:14:23,720
Hello.

315
00:14:24,790 --> 00:14:26,700
Would you care for a brandy?

316
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:27,930
I don't think so.

317
00:14:27,930 --> 00:14:30,030
Good choice, it's disgusting.

318
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:35,100
Sheldon, please stop trying to seduce me.

319
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:36,770
Who's trying to seduce you?

320
00:14:36,770 --> 00:14:40,050
After a long day I always turn on smooth jazz

321
00:14:40,050 --> 00:14:42,980
and spray deer musk on my inner thighs.

322
00:14:46,830 --> 00:14:49,410
I thought it smelled like a petting zoo in here.

323
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:52,430
Anything you'd like to pet?

324
00:14:52,670 --> 00:14:55,460
Not my hair. There's a lot of goop in it.

325
00:14:57,240 --> 00:14:58,840
Okay, I've had enough.

326
00:14:59,610 --> 00:15:01,080
Amy, come back.

327
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:03,940
I don't know how to open the oysters.

328
00:15:06,380 --> 00:15:08,820
So, um, what surprised you the most

329
00:15:08,820 --> 00:15:10,470
when you first came to America?

330
00:15:10,470 --> 00:15:13,670
Well, I suppose how much people care

331
00:15:13,670 --> 00:15:15,950
about Oprah's favorite things.

332
00:15:16,660 --> 00:15:18,070
I thought that, too.

333
00:15:18,070 --> 00:15:19,620
But then I got my first waffle maker

334
00:15:19,620 --> 00:15:21,730
and never questioned her again.

335
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:26,280
You know, I do have some time off this Sunday

336
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:27,650
- if you'd like to... - Hey! I saw your car...

337
00:15:27,650 --> 00:15:30,710
Oh, sorry. Am I interrupting?

338
00:15:30,710 --> 00:15:32,960
Uh... It's okay. Uh, I should get back to work.

339
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:34,670
Hi. Howard Wolowitz.

340
00:15:34,670 --> 00:15:36,330
Oh. Issabella Concepcion.

341
00:15:36,330 --> 00:15:38,440
Oh, yeah, the astronomer.

342
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:40,260
Raj told us about you.

343
00:15:40,530 --> 00:15:43,070
Hey! Free toilet paper!

344
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:48,760
You told him I was an astronomer?

345
00:15:49,790 --> 00:15:50,890
I understand.

346
00:15:50,890 --> 00:15:52,630
- Time to go. - No, p-please don't.

347
00:15:52,630 --> 00:15:54,700
It's okay, Rajesh, I'm a grown woman.

348
00:15:54,700 --> 00:15:57,810
I don't have to waste my time with someone who's embarrassed by me.

349
00:16:01,410 --> 00:16:03,750
I can keep this, right?

350
00:16:03,750 --> 00:16:05,270
Issabella!

351
00:16:05,580 --> 00:16:07,320
Issabella, wait, wait, let me explain.

352
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:09,650
If you are embarrassed by what I do,

353
00:16:09,650 --> 00:16:12,270
- why did you pursue me? - I'm sorry.

354
00:16:12,270 --> 00:16:15,070
Honestly, I-I didn't think your job would bother me,

355
00:16:15,070 --> 00:16:16,440
but I guess it did.

356
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:18,210
And I hate myself for that.

357
00:16:18,210 --> 00:16:19,610
But there's a lot of things about me

358
00:16:19,610 --> 00:16:21,510
that would totally embarrass you.

359
00:16:21,510 --> 00:16:22,940
I doubt that.

360
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:25,090
Well, prepare to be mortified.

361
00:16:26,110 --> 00:16:27,860
I let my dog eat food out of my mouth,

362
00:16:27,860 --> 00:16:30,730
not because she likes it but because I do.

363
00:16:31,210 --> 00:16:32,160
Also, I know they're pretty,

364
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:34,420
but I'm scared of butterflies.

365
00:16:35,150 --> 00:16:36,640
Sorry, just passing through.

366
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:38,520
I think this fell off your cart.

367
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:43,260
Come on. What do you say?

368
00:16:43,260 --> 00:16:45,020
Let me make it up to you.

369
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:47,080
You're very persistent.

370
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:49,110
It's my one move.

371
00:16:50,510 --> 00:16:51,830
Okay.

372
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:56,260
This Sunday night, you may take me to dinner at a nice restaurant.

373
00:16:56,260 --> 00:16:58,310
Great. Where would you like to go?

374
00:16:58,310 --> 00:16:59,490
Your choice.

375
00:16:59,490 --> 00:17:01,830
It can be Pakistani food, if you like.

376
00:17:01,830 --> 00:17:03,570
Excuse me, but I'm Indian.

377
00:17:03,570 --> 00:17:05,700
And now you know how it feels.

378
00:17:11,460 --> 00:17:14,450
So, were you turned on even a little bit?

379
00:17:14,450 --> 00:17:18,230
It was like being hit on by Rat Pack Pee-wee Herman.

380
00:17:20,790 --> 00:17:22,010
I'm sorry, is that a yes?

381
00:17:22,010 --> 00:17:23,230
No!

382
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:26,230
Amy,

383
00:17:26,810 --> 00:17:28,680
I didn't want it to come to this.

384
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:30,350
But you have left me no choice

385
00:17:30,350 --> 00:17:32,380
but to employ the most passionate,

386
00:17:32,380 --> 00:17:35,500
seductive dance known to man.

387
00:17:37,590 --> 00:17:38,840
The flamenco.

388
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:58,120
For God's sake, you're ridiculous.

389
00:18:02,450 --> 00:18:05,170
You guys are aroused, right?

390
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:10,180
That was a close one.
