1
00:00:05,240 --> 00:00:06,350
That is unbelievable.

2
00:00:06,350 --> 00:00:07,420
Good for Bert.

3
00:00:07,420 --> 00:00:09,880
Damn, the MacArthur Genius Grant.

4
00:00:09,880 --> 00:00:11,580
Couldn't have happened to a nicer guy.

5
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:14,340
Everything is stupid and I want to go home.

6
00:00:15,610 --> 00:00:16,990
That's Sheldon's way of saying

7
00:00:16,990 --> 00:00:19,030
he's proud of Bert, too.

8
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:22,200
Hey, it's not even called the "Genius Grant,"

9
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:23,870
it's the MacArthur Fellowship.

10
00:00:23,870 --> 00:00:25,030
Just like it's not Frankenstein,

11
00:00:25,030 --> 00:00:26,840
it's "Frankenstein's Monster."

12
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:30,760
Which brings us back to that hulking simpleton over there.

13
00:00:32,170 --> 00:00:33,190
And if anyone's a genius,

14
00:00:33,190 --> 00:00:35,910
it's me for the way I brought that full circle.

15
00:00:36,650 --> 00:00:37,800
How much money did he win?

16
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:39,240
Over half a million dollars.

17
00:00:39,790 --> 00:00:41,130
And he doesn't have to use it for research,

18
00:00:41,130 --> 00:00:42,650
he can do whatever he wants with it.

19
00:00:42,650 --> 00:00:47,010
Oh, good, maybe he can build a nicer bridge to live under.

20
00:00:47,660 --> 00:00:48,960
- Here he comes. - Right.

21
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:49,850
Be polite.

22
00:00:49,850 --> 00:00:50,960
I know how to behave.

23
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:52,660
Do you?

24
00:00:52,930 --> 00:00:54,380
Hey, congratulations Bert!

25
00:00:54,380 --> 00:00:55,880
- Yeah, good for you. - That's amazing.

26
00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:56,570
Thanks.

27
00:00:56,570 --> 00:00:58,520
I was as surprised as anybody.

28
00:00:58,520 --> 00:00:59,970
When they called and told me I won,

29
00:00:59,970 --> 00:01:00,980
I didn't believe them.

30
00:01:00,980 --> 00:01:03,350
And then they said, "No, you really won."

31
00:01:03,350 --> 00:01:06,360
And then I said, "Cool."

32
00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:08,690
Someone call George R. R. Martin,

33
00:01:08,690 --> 00:01:11,610
this guy knows how to finish a story.

34
00:01:11,910 --> 00:01:15,030
I've gotten pretty good at telling it.

35
00:01:15,310 --> 00:01:17,470
Well, see ya.

36
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:19,170
Some genius.

37
00:01:19,170 --> 00:01:22,590
I zinged him with sarcasm, he didn't even notice.

38
00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:23,570
I know,

39
00:01:23,570 --> 00:01:27,000
and it was the greatest sarcastic quip I've ever heard.

40
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,570
Well, aren't you a peach.

41
00:01:56,810 --> 00:01:58,840
Who leaves their bike in the hallway?

42
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:00,070
You know, if I knew how to ride one,

43
00:02:00,070 --> 00:02:01,910
I'd steal it.

44
00:02:02,550 --> 00:02:03,820
Ignore him,

45
00:02:03,820 --> 00:02:06,210
he's just cranky because Bert from the geology lab

46
00:02:06,210 --> 00:02:07,400
won a big grant.

47
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:09,330
Oh, I heard him interviewed on the radio!

48
00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:10,600
You know, when they told him he won,

49
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:12,690
he didn't believe it, but then he did believe it.

50
00:02:12,690 --> 00:02:14,780
It was so funny.

51
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:18,960
Who listens to the radio anymore?

52
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:21,960
Bert is studying the way microbes in rocks

53
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:24,030
can survive in extreme environmental conditions.

54
00:02:24,030 --> 00:02:25,510
They say it could be a potential indicator

55
00:02:25,510 --> 00:02:26,940
of life on other planets.

56
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:28,100
You know what, I've met Bert.

57
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:31,800
Isn't he an indicator of life on other planets?

58
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:36,000
You used to make those jokes about me.

59
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:39,590
Now everything is Bert, Bert, Bert!

60
00:02:40,230 --> 00:02:41,880
You know, Sheldon, maybe if you take the time

61
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:43,330
to actually read Bert's research,

62
00:02:43,330 --> 00:02:45,210
you'd be less bitter about him winning.

63
00:02:45,210 --> 00:02:48,650
You want me to read a geology paper?

64
00:02:48,650 --> 00:02:50,160
Honestly, I just want you to be quiet

65
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:52,500
but I'm all out of taffy.

66
00:02:55,850 --> 00:02:56,750
You busy?

67
00:02:56,750 --> 00:02:59,220
There's somebody out here who wants to meet you.

68
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:00,070
Who is it?

69
00:03:00,070 --> 00:03:02,480
Say hello to everybody's little friend--

70
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:06,000
remote control Stephen Hawking!

71
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:11,450
Where did you get that?

72
00:03:11,450 --> 00:03:13,860
I found him in an old box.

73
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:16,040
Why would you buy it?

74
00:03:16,470 --> 00:03:17,830
I didn't buy it.

75
00:03:17,830 --> 00:03:19,610
I made it.

76
00:03:20,350 --> 00:03:21,640
Last question.

77
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:24,220
What is wrong with you?

78
00:03:25,070 --> 00:03:26,540
What's the big deal?

79
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:28,180
Howie, it's in poor taste.

80
00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:29,720
No, it's not. Check it out.

81
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:31,430
He says fun stuff.

82
00:03:31,430 --> 00:03:33,080
Hey good lookin',

83
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:35,840
want to go for a spin?

84
00:03:41,530 --> 00:03:44,120
His eyes also light up in the dark.

85
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:53,640
It's always fun watching him read someone else's work.

86
00:04:08,130 --> 00:04:12,090
It's like scrolling through the emojis on my phone.

87
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:15,480
Ye-- why?

88
00:04:16,900 --> 00:04:18,980
Eh, why?!

89
00:04:20,970 --> 00:04:22,900
Oh, that's why.

90
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:26,360
Sounds like the night we had coitus.

91
00:04:28,270 --> 00:04:30,530
I hope you're happy making me read this.

92
00:04:30,530 --> 00:04:31,760
Bert's work is remarkable.

93
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:33,370
And I'm more upset than ever.

94
00:04:33,370 --> 00:04:34,830
This is worse than when I had to admit that

95
00:04:34,830 --> 00:04:37,880
Cedric the Entertainer's actually entertaining.

96
00:04:38,550 --> 00:04:42,370
Sheldon, it's foolish to be angry that Bert's work has merit.

97
00:04:42,370 --> 00:04:44,370
Yeah, well I-I am angry!

98
00:04:44,370 --> 00:04:45,810
And you telling me not to be angry

99
00:04:45,810 --> 00:04:47,060
makes me angry!

100
00:04:47,060 --> 00:04:48,110
And do you know how hearing myself

101
00:04:48,110 --> 00:04:50,160
say the word angry over and over makes me feel?

102
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:52,480
- Ooh, a-angry? - What are you doing?

103
00:04:53,740 --> 00:04:57,140
I-I-I knew the answer. I got excited.

104
00:04:57,610 --> 00:04:59,260
Hey, buddy, why don't we go for a walk,

105
00:04:59,260 --> 00:05:01,050
so you can calm down.

106
00:05:01,470 --> 00:05:02,880
That's a good idea.

107
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:05,710
I guess everyone's having them now.

108
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:07,820
Hey, I'm trying to help you.

109
00:05:07,820 --> 00:05:08,740
Fine.

110
00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:11,850
You can walk ahead of me and scare off the pigeons.

111
00:05:14,290 --> 00:05:18,180
Just wave your arms a little and they fly away, it's not...

112
00:05:20,450 --> 00:05:21,870
Okay, Raj,

113
00:05:21,870 --> 00:05:23,920
I'm gonna show you something.

114
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:27,170
Now, one of us thinks it's offensive.

115
00:05:27,170 --> 00:05:29,330
The other thinks it's hilarious

116
00:05:29,330 --> 00:05:31,440
and a great idea.

117
00:05:32,410 --> 00:05:34,540
But, I'm not going to tell you

118
00:05:34,540 --> 00:05:36,440
who likes it.

119
00:05:44,340 --> 00:05:46,390
This is tough.

120
00:05:47,190 --> 00:05:48,880
But I'm going to say

121
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:50,870
it's the guy who shows me YouTube videos

122
00:05:50,870 --> 00:05:53,950
of people getting hit in the nuts.

123
00:05:55,570 --> 00:05:56,580
You're crazy.

124
00:05:56,580 --> 00:05:57,660
I've worked with Hawking.

125
00:05:57,660 --> 00:05:59,280
He's got a great sense of humor.

126
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:00,500
And I think he'd like it.

127
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:02,530
Okay, call him and show him.

128
00:06:02,530 --> 00:06:03,920
I dare you.

129
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:06,040
I have no problem calling him.

130
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:07,180
Fine, then do it.

131
00:06:07,180 --> 00:06:09,140
Fine, I will.

132
00:06:11,330 --> 00:06:14,020
While you're bothering the world's most famous scientist,

133
00:06:14,020 --> 00:06:15,510
be sure to show him how funny he looks

134
00:06:15,510 --> 00:06:18,710
getting stuck under our dishwasher.

135
00:06:19,990 --> 00:06:21,310
What's this button do?

136
00:06:21,310 --> 00:06:25,590
Gentlemen, start your wheelchairs.

137
00:06:21,310 --> 00:06:26,660
{\an8}"Gentlemen. Start Your Engines!"

138
00:06:28,790 --> 00:06:32,070
You laughed when that guy got hit in the nuts.

139
00:06:33,510 --> 00:06:36,790
I laughed because the guy was Leonard.

140
00:06:40,190 --> 00:06:41,950
I admire you, Leonard.

141
00:06:41,950 --> 00:06:43,980
Really, why?

142
00:06:43,980 --> 00:06:46,380
You're happy with who you are.

143
00:06:46,380 --> 00:06:48,910
You don't get jealous of other people.

144
00:06:49,050 --> 00:06:51,820
Instead of being weighed down by ambition,

145
00:06:51,820 --> 00:06:56,310
you just float along like a dead body in a river.

146
00:06:58,370 --> 00:06:59,420
I couldn't just take the compliment.

147
00:06:59,420 --> 00:07:01,370
I had to ask why.

148
00:07:04,020 --> 00:07:06,860
You know, I do understand what you're feeling.

149
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:08,410
My brother and sister's accomplishments

150
00:07:08,410 --> 00:07:11,290
have always been held over my head.

151
00:07:11,540 --> 00:07:13,130
How did you deal with it?

152
00:07:13,130 --> 00:07:14,750
I wet the bed until college,

153
00:07:14,750 --> 00:07:17,860
but I don't think that's a quality fix.

154
00:07:20,140 --> 00:07:23,250
I can't believe I was surpassed by a geologist.

155
00:07:23,250 --> 00:07:24,330
I mean...

156
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:26,650
rocks!

157
00:07:26,650 --> 00:07:28,970
He studies rocks!

158
00:07:28,970 --> 00:07:32,650
If rock is so great, how come paper beats it?

159
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:38,260
Leonard, I'm having a primal urge to throw this rock.

160
00:07:38,260 --> 00:07:39,430
Do it.

161
00:07:39,430 --> 00:07:41,150
Visualize it as your anger

162
00:07:41,150 --> 00:07:44,740
a-and-and toss it out of your life.

163
00:07:45,140 --> 00:07:47,340
Perhaps I will.

164
00:07:50,990 --> 00:07:52,390
This rock

165
00:07:52,390 --> 00:07:56,100
encapsulates all my negative emotions.

166
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:59,280
I will cast you far away.

167
00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:03,040
Feel free to take out a pigeon while you're at it.

168
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:06,400
Let it fly.

169
00:08:13,780 --> 00:08:15,290
What happened?

170
00:08:15,290 --> 00:08:16,970
I tried to let go of anger

171
00:08:16,970 --> 00:08:19,870
and threw a rock into my foot!

172
00:08:20,620 --> 00:08:22,670
Then he got more angry and kicked the rock

173
00:08:22,670 --> 00:08:24,370
- with his other foot. - Wha--?

174
00:08:24,370 --> 00:08:25,840
And what happened to you?

175
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:27,000
Oh, I laughed so hard,

176
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,520
I burst a blood vessel in my nose. It's fine.

177
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:36,940
You know, it's one thing to be envious,

178
00:08:36,940 --> 00:08:38,790
but now you're injuring yourself.

179
00:08:38,790 --> 00:08:40,050
It has to stop.

180
00:08:40,050 --> 00:08:41,590
Although if you are gonna do it again,

181
00:08:41,590 --> 00:08:44,290
please let me know, so I can get it on video.

182
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:46,280
You know, Sheldon,

183
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:49,020
instead of fixating on what Bert has,

184
00:08:49,020 --> 00:08:51,870
you should appreciate all of the good things in your life.

185
00:08:51,870 --> 00:08:53,410
Y-You've got love,

186
00:08:53,410 --> 00:08:54,490
you're in good health,

187
00:08:54,490 --> 00:08:56,590
you've got a roof over your head.

188
00:08:56,590 --> 00:08:59,180
Yeah, but you've got all those things,

189
00:08:59,180 --> 00:09:01,540
and no one's lining up to be you.

190
00:09:03,770 --> 00:09:04,920
Anybody else want to try?

191
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:05,830
I'm gonna go make some more tea

192
00:09:05,830 --> 00:09:08,170
and question my life choices.

193
00:09:08,780 --> 00:09:10,160
You're up.

194
00:09:11,510 --> 00:09:15,230
This is getting old fast, Dolores, knock it off!

195
00:09:15,850 --> 00:09:18,890
Uh, do you really think calling me names is helpful?

196
00:09:18,890 --> 00:09:19,350
I do!

197
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:22,130
Your life is fine, you big baby!

198
00:09:22,130 --> 00:09:23,180
Maybe you're right.

199
00:09:23,180 --> 00:09:24,770
Really?!

200
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:26,880
If it helps,

201
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:29,950
I'm questioning your life choices, too.

202
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:30,940
Thank you, Penny.

203
00:09:30,940 --> 00:09:32,580
You know, I just need to keep reminding myself

204
00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:35,280
that Bert's success is not my failure.

205
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:36,210
There you go.

206
00:09:36,210 --> 00:09:37,890
And that men of his large stature

207
00:09:37,890 --> 00:09:41,770
are more susceptible to a wide array of life-threatening diseases.

208
00:09:42,170 --> 00:09:43,930
There you go...

209
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:51,050
What's up?

210
00:09:51,050 --> 00:09:52,850
I'm conducting a quick survey.

211
00:09:52,850 --> 00:09:55,260
Do you think this respectful

212
00:09:55,260 --> 00:09:58,480
and loving tribute to a great man

213
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:01,440
is in poor taste?

214
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:10,510
Yep.

215
00:10:12,930 --> 00:10:15,080
Do you think this is in poor taste?

216
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:16,810
Does it spin around and do tricks?

217
00:10:16,810 --> 00:10:17,560
Yeah!

218
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:18,860
Then yeah.

219
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:21,210
What do you think?

220
00:10:21,210 --> 00:10:24,940
That is hilarious!

221
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:26,630
Give me the remote control.

222
00:10:26,630 --> 00:10:29,270
I want to drive him into the girls' restroom.

223
00:10:30,470 --> 00:10:33,010
All right, we're done. It's offensive.

224
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:45,550
Top of the afternoon, gentlemen.

225
00:10:45,550 --> 00:10:46,650
You're in a good mood.

226
00:10:46,650 --> 00:10:49,300
Well, it's a new day. I have a new outlook.

227
00:10:49,300 --> 00:10:50,380
You know, I realized

228
00:10:50,380 --> 00:10:52,670
I don't need to worry about other people.

229
00:10:52,670 --> 00:10:56,160
I just need to think more about myself.

230
00:10:58,990 --> 00:11:02,670
Oh, how will we ever get used to the new you?

231
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:05,860
Well, I'm glad to see you moving forward.

232
00:11:05,860 --> 00:11:07,820
Bert did quality research.

233
00:11:07,820 --> 00:11:11,390
And he deserves whatever accolades he receives.

234
00:11:11,390 --> 00:11:12,700
What is going on?

235
00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:15,390
Did you upgrade his software last night?

236
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:18,420
I think he might be learning on his own.

237
00:11:18,420 --> 00:11:21,750
Then the robot uprising has begun.

238
00:11:22,090 --> 00:11:24,230
Excuse me, I need to pay Bert

239
00:11:24,230 --> 00:11:27,100
a proper congratulations.

240
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:31,600
He doesn't just look like C-3PO,

241
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:33,850
now he walks like him.

242
00:11:35,370 --> 00:11:36,040
Bert?

243
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:39,100
I wanted to let you know that I read your research,

244
00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:42,240
and your award is well-deserved.

245
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:43,350
Thanks.

246
00:11:43,350 --> 00:11:44,910
I've been hearing that a lot.

247
00:11:44,910 --> 00:11:48,100
Ever since I won, people think I'm great.

248
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:50,570
Well, just this once,

249
00:11:50,570 --> 00:11:54,200
you can count me as people, too.

250
00:11:55,890 --> 00:11:58,490
You know, as a MacArthur Grant winner,

251
00:11:58,490 --> 00:12:00,850
I'm allowed to nominate someone for next year.

252
00:12:00,850 --> 00:12:02,500
Really?

253
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:04,950
I didn't know that.

254
00:12:04,950 --> 00:12:06,410
So I was thinking, you know,

255
00:12:06,410 --> 00:12:08,550
engineers don't get a lot of respect.

256
00:12:08,550 --> 00:12:12,030
Is your friend Howard working on anything cool?

257
00:12:14,190 --> 00:12:15,800
You know, I-I'm not sure.

258
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:17,980
You know, you'd have to ask him.

259
00:12:17,980 --> 00:12:19,890
Excuse me.

260
00:12:30,980 --> 00:12:35,570
Leonard! I hurt myself again.

261
00:12:36,250 --> 00:12:40,050
Excuse me, I-I have to go take some pictures.

262
00:12:41,930 --> 00:12:45,140
I can't believe you head-butted a water fountain.

263
00:12:46,710 --> 00:12:49,900
No, I went to punch the water fountain,

264
00:12:49,900 --> 00:12:52,230
slipped in water in front of the water fountain,

265
00:12:52,230 --> 00:12:54,850
and hit my head on the water fountain.

266
00:12:55,830 --> 00:12:57,930
I can't imagine you being violent.

267
00:12:57,930 --> 00:13:00,290
It's not hard. Just picture the Three Stooges,

268
00:13:00,290 --> 00:13:02,970
and then take away two stooges.

269
00:13:03,820 --> 00:13:06,240
I'm so disappointed in myself.

270
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:08,620
Jealousy is completely illogical.

271
00:13:08,620 --> 00:13:10,120
It's a human emotion, Sheldon.

272
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:11,790
Everyone gets jealous.

273
00:13:11,790 --> 00:13:13,330
I'm jealous of Leonard and Penny

274
00:13:13,330 --> 00:13:14,210
and Howard and Bernadette

275
00:13:14,210 --> 00:13:16,140
for being in such happy relationships.

276
00:13:16,140 --> 00:13:18,100
What about me and Sheldon?

277
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:22,780
Sure.

278
00:13:25,860 --> 00:13:27,380
I've always been jealous of how much money

279
00:13:27,380 --> 00:13:29,010
Raj's family has.

280
00:13:29,010 --> 00:13:31,290
Thank you for saying that. Next to buying things,

281
00:13:31,290 --> 00:13:34,060
that is the best part about having money.

282
00:13:35,060 --> 00:13:36,470
Ever since I met Penny,

283
00:13:36,470 --> 00:13:38,540
I've been envious of her looks.

284
00:13:38,540 --> 00:13:40,350
Aw, thank you.

285
00:13:40,350 --> 00:13:42,030
That's why I was so happy when you cut your hair off.

286
00:13:42,030 --> 00:13:43,590
What?!

287
00:13:43,930 --> 00:13:44,810
You know what I mean.

288
00:13:44,810 --> 00:13:46,240
You were still hot, but more like a

289
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:49,850
"Why'd that hot girl cut off all her hair?" hot.

290
00:13:50,250 --> 00:13:52,590
You liked my short hair, right?

291
00:13:52,590 --> 00:13:55,000
Yeah... I loved it.

292
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,170
Love you, love the hair,

293
00:13:56,170 --> 00:13:58,670
would love to change the subject.

294
00:14:00,390 --> 00:14:03,210
Seriously, none of you liked it?

295
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:04,950
I thought it was brave.

296
00:14:04,950 --> 00:14:07,230
Does that count as liking it?

297
00:14:08,830 --> 00:14:10,160
You know, how come nobody's talking about

298
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:13,150
Howard's dopey haircut?

299
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:17,480
I think he looks cute.

300
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:18,500
And I think you're cute.

301
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:19,430
I think you're both cute.

302
00:14:19,430 --> 00:14:22,290
I think I hate all of you nerds.

303
00:14:28,390 --> 00:14:30,430
Sorry I'm moving slowly.

304
00:14:30,430 --> 00:14:31,640
Oh, I don't mind.

305
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:32,980
If you pull a butterscotch out of your pocket,

306
00:14:32,980 --> 00:14:35,760
it would be like I'm walking with my grandma.

307
00:14:38,930 --> 00:14:40,190
Oh, no.

308
00:14:44,660 --> 00:14:47,330
Did you... A plaque?

309
00:14:47,330 --> 00:14:50,040
Nobody wants to see this.

310
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:52,130
Well, change "Plaque" to "Mixed-race couple"

311
00:14:52,130 --> 00:14:54,530
and you are my grandma.

312
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:57,250
I can't take this anymore.

313
00:14:58,950 --> 00:15:02,290
Bert. Bert. Bert!

314
00:15:02,290 --> 00:15:03,500
Come in.

315
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:04,530
All right, let's do this...

316
00:15:10,130 --> 00:15:11,270
Bert?

317
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:13,130
We need to talk.

318
00:15:13,130 --> 00:15:14,790
What happened to you?

319
00:15:14,790 --> 00:15:17,410
Rock, rock, water fountain.

320
00:15:19,620 --> 00:15:21,280
I am not proud of this.

321
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:24,530
But I have been envious of your recent success.

322
00:15:24,530 --> 00:15:27,490
Wow, I won the MacArthur Grant,

323
00:15:27,490 --> 00:15:29,180
everyone's jealous of me.

324
00:15:29,180 --> 00:15:32,710
Once I get Lasik, I'll be out of things to wish for.

325
00:15:33,550 --> 00:15:35,920
I was hoping by admitting my weakness to you,

326
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:37,850
I'd somehow be unburdened.

327
00:15:37,850 --> 00:15:38,940
- Is it working? - No.

328
00:15:38,940 --> 00:15:40,000
Now that you know my weakness,

329
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,250
I hate you more than ever.

330
00:15:43,140 --> 00:15:46,080
Well, you know, we're both pretty smart.

331
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:47,550
I bet if we put our heads together,

332
00:15:47,550 --> 00:15:50,000
we could come up with a solution.

333
00:15:50,060 --> 00:15:51,860
We... Hang on.

334
00:15:51,860 --> 00:15:53,710
You're my enemy.

335
00:15:53,710 --> 00:15:55,920
Now, the enemy of the enemy is my friend.

336
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:58,420
And right now, I'm my own worst enemy.

337
00:15:58,420 --> 00:15:59,360
That makes you my fr--

338
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:01,190
Okay, I'm good to go.

339
00:16:02,010 --> 00:16:02,980
Great.

340
00:16:02,980 --> 00:16:04,610
Now that we're friends, want to see if we can

341
00:16:04,610 --> 00:16:07,390
get tickets to a taping of Ellen?

342
00:16:10,140 --> 00:16:12,260
You know what? This isn't gonna work.

343
00:16:12,630 --> 00:16:15,050
Sheldon... wait.

344
00:16:15,390 --> 00:16:18,590
You know, you've got a lot to be happy about.

345
00:16:18,590 --> 00:16:20,660
You're at the top of your field,

346
00:16:20,660 --> 00:16:22,460
you have a great girlfriend.

347
00:16:22,460 --> 00:16:24,460
Yes! That's right!

348
00:16:24,460 --> 00:16:26,140
I have Amy!

349
00:16:28,970 --> 00:16:32,180
In the past, you've professed feelings for her.

350
00:16:32,180 --> 00:16:33,520
Does it eat you up inside

351
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:35,520
that I have her and you don't?

352
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:37,180
It used to.

353
00:16:37,180 --> 00:16:39,240
But now that I'm rich and successful,

354
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:41,550
I think I can do better.

355
00:16:43,540 --> 00:16:46,310
I can't believe you punched Bert.

356
00:16:47,170 --> 00:16:48,920
I didn't punch him.

357
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:50,640
He turned around, and I gave him

358
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:53,370
a Captain Kirk karate chop.

359
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:56,430
I'm not even sure he knows I did it.

360
00:16:57,420 --> 00:16:58,370
Hey, Sheldon,

361
00:16:58,370 --> 00:17:01,270
I've got someone here who might make you feel better.

362
00:17:01,270 --> 00:17:02,910
Hello, Sheldon.

363
00:17:02,910 --> 00:17:04,830
Professor Hawking!

364
00:17:04,830 --> 00:17:05,830
I understand

365
00:17:05,830 --> 00:17:08,860
you're struggling with professional jealousy.

366
00:17:08,860 --> 00:17:12,060
Thanks, Leonard, now he's not gonna think I'm cool.

367
00:17:12,620 --> 00:17:15,640
Don't worry, I know how you feel.

368
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:18,710
I have never won a Nobel Prize.

369
00:17:18,710 --> 00:17:21,100
Oh, wow, that doesn't seem fair.

370
00:17:21,100 --> 00:17:22,080
It's fine.

371
00:17:22,080 --> 00:17:25,240
I've been on The Simpsons.

372
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:28,940
How do you deal with the success of your colleagues?

373
00:17:28,940 --> 00:17:30,280
I remind myself

374
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:33,860
every scientific advancement is a victory.

375
00:17:33,860 --> 00:17:37,340
Also, I was on Star Trek.

376
00:17:38,350 --> 00:17:41,110
Oh, it was a good one. He played poker with Sir Isaac...

377
00:17:41,110 --> 00:17:42,860
You don't care.

378
00:17:43,740 --> 00:17:46,920
Don't waste your time on jealousy, Sheldon,

379
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:49,090
you're too brilliant.

380
00:17:49,090 --> 00:17:50,310
How can you feel bad

381
00:17:50,310 --> 00:17:52,770
if Stephen Hawking says you're brilliant?

382
00:17:52,770 --> 00:17:54,340
I can't.

383
00:17:54,340 --> 00:17:56,350
Thank you, Professor Hawking.

384
00:17:56,350 --> 00:17:58,320
You are a gift to mankind.

385
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:00,970
There should be statues of you everywhere.

386
00:18:00,970 --> 00:18:02,930
You know, the Lincoln Memorial has a big chair.

387
00:18:02,930 --> 00:18:05,490
We could swap you right in.

388
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:11,670
I always thought a motorized toy of me would be cool.

389
00:18:14,420 --> 00:18:16,540
What a wonderful idea!

390
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:19,060
How does this man not have a Nobel?

391
00:18:19,060 --> 00:18:21,500
- Do not tell Wolowitz. - Way ahead of you.

392
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:28,370
A new study came out, and it said that laughing

393
00:18:28,370 --> 00:18:30,890
makes your brain work better.

394
00:18:30,890 --> 00:18:32,530
And I know that's true because laughing

395
00:18:32,530 --> 00:18:35,100
has made me the "Smartiest."

396
00:18:36,250 --> 00:18:37,560
Although, on the other hand,

397
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:40,050
babies laugh a lot, and they're dumb.

398
00:18:40,850 --> 00:18:42,600
Do people know about her?

399
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:45,230
'Cause she's delightful.
