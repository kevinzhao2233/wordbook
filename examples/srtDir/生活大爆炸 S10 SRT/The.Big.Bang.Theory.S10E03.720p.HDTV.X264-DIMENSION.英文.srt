10
00:00:02,270 --> 00:00:04,090
It's pretty late. You think we got time

11
00:00:04,090 --> 00:00:06,720
to run somemore simulations on the cooling system?

12
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:09,610
Sure, I'm still figuring out the thermoacoustic expander.

13
00:00:09,610 --> 00:00:11,790
Oh, while you do that I am going to

14
00:00:11,790 --> 00:00:15,200
pump cerebral spinal fluid through my brain cells

15
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:18,940
to remove the metabolic by-products of the day's thoughts.

16
00:00:19,860 --> 00:00:20,430
What?

17
00:00:20,430 --> 00:00:22,160
It's called sleep and it's my bedtime.

18
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:24,070
Nighty-night, y'all.

19
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:26,540
Hey, hey, hey, you're not going anywhere.

20
00:00:26,540 --> 00:00:28,640
We only have two months to deliver this to the Air Force

21
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:29,970
because of you.

22
00:00:29,970 --> 00:00:32,500
I know, I was there.

23
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:34,010
Well, wake up!

24
00:00:34,010 --> 00:00:36,110
We're gonna put in a lot of late nights.

25
00:00:36,110 --> 00:00:37,300
How late?

26
00:00:37,300 --> 00:00:40,410
Well, I don't know, midnight, 1:00.

27
00:00:40,410 --> 00:00:41,390
One o'clock?

28
00:00:41,390 --> 00:00:44,140
I'm not a raccoon.

29
00:00:45,070 --> 00:00:47,110
If you're tired, have some coffee.

30
00:00:47,110 --> 00:00:48,350
What? You have some coffee.

31
00:00:48,350 --> 00:00:50,330
I am having coffee!

32
00:00:50,330 --> 00:00:53,030
- And look how irritable it's making you! - Guys!

33
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:56,030
We're not gonna get anything done if we start fighting.

34
00:00:56,030 --> 00:00:58,660
Now, can you please try to soldier through?

35
00:00:59,610 --> 00:01:00,860
Fine.

36
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:17,200
I don't think I can go much longer.

37
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:19,910
It's been three and a half minutes, wake up!

38
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:53,330
I had a bad dream that my best friend became a tyrant

39
00:01:53,330 --> 00:01:55,880
and forced me to stay up all night to work.

40
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:57,900
Oh, I had a good dream that when I carried you to bed,

41
00:01:57,900 --> 00:02:01,200
I let your head hit the wall and I laughed.

42
00:02:02,010 --> 00:02:02,900
Good morning.

43
00:02:02,900 --> 00:02:03,770
What is this?

44
00:02:03,770 --> 00:02:05,430
Well, we didn't see you last night,

45
00:02:05,430 --> 00:02:06,610
we're not gonna see you today,

46
00:02:06,610 --> 00:02:08,560
so we thought we could have breakfast together.

47
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:10,040
Oh, that is so nice.

48
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:12,630
Ow, it does hurt!

49
00:02:13,970 --> 00:02:15,450
So, what are you guys gonna do today?

50
00:02:15,450 --> 00:02:18,110
Well, Sheldon was supposed to go to this party with me this afternoon,

51
00:02:18,110 --> 00:02:19,420
but I don't think that's happening.

52
00:02:19,420 --> 00:02:21,340
Oh, that was never happening.

53
00:02:22,070 --> 00:02:23,000
Oh, I'll go.

54
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,130
I like a party.

55
00:02:24,130 --> 00:02:26,910
Well, to be honest, it's not like a "party" party,

56
00:02:26,910 --> 00:02:28,120
it's more like a gathering

57
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:30,230
where scientists of different disciplines get together

58
00:02:30,230 --> 00:02:31,070
to share their work

59
00:02:31,070 --> 00:02:32,920
and keep current on what's going on in other fields.

60
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:35,450
I don't know why I called it a party, sorry.

61
00:02:35,790 --> 00:02:37,290
It's okay, I'll still go.

62
00:02:37,290 --> 00:02:38,600
You don't think you'll be bored?

63
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:39,900
Oh, I'll have some wine

64
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:42,190
and listen to people go on about crap I don't understand.

65
00:02:42,190 --> 00:02:45,810
I mean, how is it any different than every single day of my life?

66
00:02:46,380 --> 00:02:48,200
I won't be there.

67
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:50,720
Look at that, it is a party.

68
00:02:52,830 --> 00:02:54,710
Sorry I have to work all weekend.

69
00:02:54,710 --> 00:02:55,800
It's okay.

70
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:57,480
Thanks again for breakfast.

71
00:02:57,480 --> 00:03:00,180
Well, I didn't get to see you last night.

72
00:03:00,550 --> 00:03:01,820
It was the least I could do.

73
00:03:01,820 --> 00:03:05,820
You shouldn't have made the alarm code his birthday.

74
00:03:07,030 --> 00:03:10,040
So, what should we do today?

75
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:10,890
Oh, I appreciate it,

76
00:03:10,890 --> 00:03:12,670
but you don't have to spend your day off with me.

77
00:03:12,670 --> 00:03:14,220
Well, I don't mind.

78
00:03:14,220 --> 00:03:16,550
Oh, you want go to the mall and look at baby stuff?

79
00:03:16,550 --> 00:03:17,500
Not really.

80
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:19,210
Oh, come on, we could share a pretzel

81
00:03:19,210 --> 00:03:23,330
and get sideways glances from racist old ladies.

82
00:03:24,070 --> 00:03:25,490
I get enough of that when I take Howard

83
00:03:25,490 --> 00:03:28,530
to my grandmother's for Christmas.

84
00:03:28,690 --> 00:03:29,950
Oh, I know,

85
00:03:29,950 --> 00:03:32,680
why don't we get started on clearing out the baby's room?

86
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:34,300
Isn't it a little early for that?

87
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:35,860
You have to get to it eventually.

88
00:03:35,860 --> 00:03:38,840
Oh, there's so much junk in there, it's embarrassing.

89
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:40,820
How can you be embarrassed around me?

90
00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:44,270
I'm gonna be in the room with you when you give birth.

91
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:52,220
I don't think you are.

92
00:03:52,670 --> 00:03:54,600
You didn't think I was gonna be in your kitchen this morning,

93
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:56,770
yet here I am.

94
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:05,590
Hey, kid.

95
00:04:05,590 --> 00:04:06,320
Huh, what?

96
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:10,720
You look tired.

97
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:12,630
Why don't you have an energy drink?

98
00:04:12,630 --> 00:04:14,610
Everyone's doing it.

99
00:04:16,140 --> 00:04:19,130
Oh, no, thank you, those have caffeine in them.

100
00:04:19,130 --> 00:04:22,090
Oh, sorry, I thought you were cool.

101
00:04:24,110 --> 00:04:25,360
I am cool.

102
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:26,770
This is Yoo-hoo,

103
00:04:26,770 --> 00:04:29,650
chocolate milk's delicious watery cousin.

104
00:04:30,050 --> 00:04:31,050
All right.

105
00:04:31,050 --> 00:04:34,230
But if you ever want to feel like you have superpowers,

106
00:04:34,230 --> 00:04:36,000
try one of these.

107
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,280
Superheroes take performance-enhancing chemicals?

108
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:40,270
You bet.

109
00:04:40,270 --> 00:04:42,570
You know why Hulk is so strong?

110
00:04:42,570 --> 00:04:44,980
Steroids.

111
00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:48,620
You know why Batman wanders around at night

112
00:04:48,620 --> 00:04:50,160
getting into fights?

113
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:52,490
Scotch.

114
00:04:54,540 --> 00:04:57,350
I am facing a great deal of work.

115
00:04:57,350 --> 00:05:01,990
And I do like things better when famous people also like them.

116
00:05:02,650 --> 00:05:03,530
Here.

117
00:05:03,530 --> 00:05:05,710
It's on the house.

118
00:05:06,590 --> 00:05:08,880
The first one's free?

119
00:05:09,340 --> 00:05:11,850
Flash, how do you stay in business?

120
00:05:11,850 --> 00:05:13,870
You want to know my secret?

121
00:05:13,870 --> 00:05:17,130
I bought stock in Marvel.

123
00:05:19,610 --> 00:05:20,430
Hi, Bert.

124
00:05:20,430 --> 00:05:21,440
This is my friend, Penny.

125
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:23,150
- Hi. - Hey, come on in.

126
00:05:23,150 --> 00:05:25,730
I'll gonna go turn on some rock music.

127
00:05:25,730 --> 00:05:28,240
That's a geology joke.

128
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:29,610
Bert's a geologist.

129
00:05:29,610 --> 00:05:31,740
And a joker.

130
00:05:34,130 --> 00:05:35,600
How early are we?

131
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:38,090
Oh, actually, we're an hour late.

132
00:05:38,530 --> 00:05:41,780
I suddenly wish Sheldon was here.

133
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:48,270
I don't even know where to begin.

134
00:05:48,270 --> 00:05:51,120
Well, in The Sound of Music, Julie Andrews says,

136
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:52,380
"Let's start at the very beginning.

137
00:05:52,380 --> 00:05:54,870
A very good place to start."

138
00:05:55,890 --> 00:05:57,670
Oh, I was gonna start at the end.

139
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:59,660
Thank God you're here.

140
00:06:01,630 --> 00:06:03,030
Well, I think the first thing we should get rid of is

141
00:06:03,030 --> 00:06:04,860
that tone.

142
00:06:05,830 --> 00:06:07,580
Sorry.

143
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:10,480
I should probably keep this in case we have a girl.

144
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:11,860
Oh, that's a nice one.

145
00:06:11,860 --> 00:06:13,110
Was it yours when you were little?

146
00:06:13,110 --> 00:06:14,380
My dad built it for me.

147
00:06:14,380 --> 00:06:16,540
Wow, it's so cute.

148
00:06:16,540 --> 00:06:18,910
This was the husband and this was the wife.

149
00:06:18,910 --> 00:06:21,090
They'd go out on adventures together.

150
00:06:21,090 --> 00:06:23,410
Cruises, skiing, horseback riding.

151
00:06:23,410 --> 00:06:27,050
That was really me just duct taping them to our dog.

152
00:06:27,460 --> 00:06:28,560
Oh, and did they have kids?

153
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:29,470
They did,

154
00:06:29,470 --> 00:06:31,070
but the mommy and daddy didn't like them,

155
00:06:31,070 --> 00:06:32,690
so they shipped them off to an orphanage

156
00:06:32,690 --> 00:06:34,630
I made out of a shoebox.

157
00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:38,930
Yeah, that's not worrisome at all.

158
00:06:39,750 --> 00:06:42,760
Not every girl dreams about being a mom.

159
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:44,850
Sometimes you think you're never gonna have kids

160
00:06:44,850 --> 00:06:46,740
and one day you wake up and you're pregnant.

161
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:48,610
And it doesn't matter that your career's going great right now

162
00:06:48,610 --> 00:06:50,860
and that you and your husband never even got to go anywhere

163
00:06:50,860 --> 00:06:53,300
taped to a dog!

164
00:06:55,220 --> 00:06:57,770
I skipped spin class for this.

165
00:07:00,950 --> 00:07:03,180
Why is it taking him so long

166
00:07:03,180 --> 00:07:05,130
to get a drink out of a vending machine?

167
00:07:05,130 --> 00:07:06,770
Oh, it's complicated.

168
00:07:06,770 --> 00:07:08,230
He finds pushing that little door

169
00:07:08,230 --> 00:07:12,600
and reaching up into the machine uncomfortably intimate.

170
00:07:13,450 --> 00:07:15,440
Gentlemen, I am ready to work.

171
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:18,690
To quote The Martian, "Let's science the feces out of this!"

172
00:07:18,690 --> 00:07:20,550
That's The Martian the book and The Martian the movie,

173
00:07:20,550 --> 00:07:21,720
not Marvin the Martian.

174
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:23,150
Although to quote Marvin the Martian,

175
00:07:23,150 --> 00:07:26,820
"I claim this planet in the name of Mars."

176
00:07:27,250 --> 00:07:28,260
Are you okay?

177
00:07:28,260 --> 00:07:30,230
Oh, I'm fantastic, never been better.

178
00:07:30,230 --> 00:07:32,480
I had my first energy drink and I feel great.

179
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:33,790
Hey, you guys want to wrestle?

180
00:07:33,790 --> 00:07:35,710
We can do arm, thumb, mud, sumo.

181
00:07:35,710 --> 00:07:38,600
Nah, we're not fat enough, or wearing diapers.

182
00:07:41,130 --> 00:07:43,640
You wanted him awake.

183
00:07:54,370 --> 00:07:58,990
So should we talk to each other or mingle?

184
00:07:59,590 --> 00:08:01,410
I don't know where everyone is.

185
00:08:01,410 --> 00:08:02,040
Yeah, I mean,

186
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:04,430
I could see him eating one or two guests,

187
00:08:04,430 --> 00:08:06,850
but not a whole party.

188
00:08:07,060 --> 00:08:09,800
Well, I guess this is kind of a bust.

189
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:11,140
You don't have to stay.

190
00:08:11,140 --> 00:08:13,020
I'm gonna start cleaning up.

191
00:08:13,020 --> 00:08:14,380
Okay.

192
00:08:14,780 --> 00:08:16,510
I feel so bad about leaving him here.

193
00:08:16,510 --> 00:08:19,790
Oh, it's funny, I was just thinking the same thing about you.

194
00:08:20,890 --> 00:08:22,050
Hey, listen,

195
00:08:22,050 --> 00:08:24,090
could you not say anything about this

196
00:08:24,090 --> 00:08:26,210
to the people at the university?

197
00:08:26,210 --> 00:08:27,300
You know, 'cause...

198
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:30,530
you're you and I'm me, and it's kind of embarrassing.

199
00:08:30,530 --> 00:08:32,750
Wait, what do you mean "she's her"?

200
00:08:32,750 --> 00:08:35,900
Well, you know how Amy's the coolest girl on campus, right?

201
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:37,890
- No. - No.

202
00:08:37,890 --> 00:08:40,240
Oh yeah, everybody thinks so.

203
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:40,970
What?

204
00:08:40,970 --> 00:08:44,650
You tell me about your foot fungus, but this is a secret?

205
00:08:45,790 --> 00:08:48,370
I'm sure it's just 'cause I'm dating Sheldon.

206
00:08:48,370 --> 00:08:50,390
Mm, actually, I think Sheldon's popular

207
00:08:50,390 --> 00:08:52,600
because he's dating you.

208
00:08:54,090 --> 00:08:55,310
Now Sheldon's popular?

209
00:08:55,310 --> 00:08:57,580
What is happening?

210
00:09:01,210 --> 00:09:02,940
Maybe we should break for lunch.

211
00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:04,150
What time is it?

212
00:09:07,850 --> 00:09:11,380
According to the world's worst cuckoo clock, it's 2:00.

213
00:09:11,780 --> 00:09:13,130
My head hurts

214
00:09:13,130 --> 00:09:15,650
and I'm more tired than ever.

215
00:09:15,650 --> 00:09:16,620
Why don't you just go home?

216
00:09:16,620 --> 00:09:18,580
No, I can do this.

217
00:09:18,580 --> 00:09:21,640
I just, I just need another energy drink.

218
00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:23,420
Oh, no.

219
00:09:24,270 --> 00:09:25,070
What?

220
00:09:25,070 --> 00:09:26,550
I want another one.

221
00:09:26,550 --> 00:09:27,640
So?

222
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:29,260
That's a craving.

223
00:09:29,260 --> 00:09:32,010
That's a sign of chemical dependency.

224
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:34,020
You only had one.

225
00:09:34,020 --> 00:09:34,990
No, I know,

226
00:09:34,990 --> 00:09:37,830
but plenty of things are addictive after a single exposure.

227
00:09:37,830 --> 00:09:41,830
I mean, crack cocaine, nicotine, Pringles.

228
00:09:41,830 --> 00:09:44,600
You know once one pops one just can't stop.

229
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:47,360
You can't develop a problem that fast.

230
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:48,630
You want to bet? Oh, great,

231
00:09:48,630 --> 00:09:50,620
now I'm addicted to gambling.

232
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:56,990
We can't afford to lose any more time.

233
00:09:57,460 --> 00:10:00,440
Well, this probably won't work, but has anyone ever tried

234
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:04,180
to just haul off and whoop the crazy out of him?

235
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:06,680
That's not helpful.

236
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:09,590
It's fun to think about, but it's not helpful.

237
00:10:10,770 --> 00:10:14,440
Hey, Sheldon, we are on a serious time crunch.

238
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:15,740
We can't do this without you.

239
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:17,050
Can you please pull it together?

240
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:19,380
I'm sorry. Yes, of course.

241
00:10:19,380 --> 00:10:20,650
Thank you.

242
00:10:21,150 --> 00:10:22,860
Just, please, bear with me

243
00:10:22,860 --> 00:10:26,150
if I display symptoms of caffeine withdrawal.

244
00:10:26,980 --> 00:10:28,650
No worries.

245
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:51,070
You guys stink.

247
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:54,460
Sorry I flipped out on you.

248
00:10:54,460 --> 00:10:56,290
I think it's just hormones.

249
00:10:56,290 --> 00:10:57,910
I think you were mean before you were pregnant,

250
00:10:57,910 --> 00:10:59,370
but it's fine.

251
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:03,400
So, uh, instead of cleaning out the room,

252
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:06,020
why don't we just decide on a theme for the nursery?

253
00:11:06,020 --> 00:11:07,630
Does it really need one?

254
00:11:07,630 --> 00:11:09,060
Of course it does.

255
00:11:09,060 --> 00:11:11,170
Didn't your baby room have a theme?

256
00:11:11,170 --> 00:11:12,860
Well, it doubled as my dad's office,

257
00:11:12,860 --> 00:11:13,980
and he was a cop,

258
00:11:13,980 --> 00:11:16,850
so I guess the theme was bloody homicide photos.

259
00:11:17,850 --> 00:11:20,900
Oh. Mine was Winnie the Pooh.

260
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:24,270
But anyway...

261
00:11:24,270 --> 00:11:26,430
why don't we just take a step back

262
00:11:26,430 --> 00:11:27,830
and start with a color?

263
00:11:27,830 --> 00:11:29,460
Right? There are so many amazing ones.

264
00:11:29,460 --> 00:11:32,310
Red, blue, green, purple...

265
00:11:32,310 --> 00:11:34,770
Are you just gonna name all the colors?

266
00:11:34,770 --> 00:11:37,730
Well, not now.

267
00:11:38,270 --> 00:11:40,630
I don't care what color the room is.

268
00:11:40,630 --> 00:11:42,050
Okay, well, I'm just trying to help you.

269
00:11:42,050 --> 00:11:44,360
Well, you're not, so just drop it!

270
00:11:48,170 --> 00:11:51,100
I'm clearly upset. Why aren't you following me?

271
00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:53,740
Sorry! Sorry!

272
00:11:55,020 --> 00:11:57,980
And when Amy started using a solution of chromic acid

273
00:11:57,980 --> 00:12:00,720
and white vinegar to clean all her lab equipment,

274
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:04,330
all of a sudden, everybody was doing it.

275
00:12:05,530 --> 00:12:07,230
You trend setter!

276
00:12:07,230 --> 00:12:09,570
Just the right idea at the right time.

277
00:12:10,490 --> 00:12:13,210
Okay, okay, so Amy's cool, Sheldon's cool.

278
00:12:13,210 --> 00:12:15,260
- Tell me about Leonard. - Who?

279
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:18,940
Leonard Hofstadter.

280
00:12:18,940 --> 00:12:21,930
Oh, him. I guess he's all right.

281
00:12:21,930 --> 00:12:25,320
Apparently he tricked some hot girl into marrying him.

282
00:12:25,900 --> 00:12:27,970
That's me, I'm her.

283
00:12:28,410 --> 00:12:29,470
You know, he didn't trick me.

284
00:12:29,470 --> 00:12:32,030
He just wore me down.

285
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:34,700
It makes sense you two are friends.

286
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:37,220
I mean, hot girls always stick together.

287
00:12:39,540 --> 00:12:42,790
And you thought this wasn't gonna be a great party.

288
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:44,600
You know, I had no idea

289
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:47,610
Caltech is exactly like my high school.

290
00:12:47,610 --> 00:12:49,510
Well, it's not exactly like it.

291
00:12:49,510 --> 00:12:51,850
We're all extremely smart.

292
00:12:53,420 --> 00:12:56,390
Wow... you popular girls are mean.

293
00:12:59,750 --> 00:13:01,530
I'm gonna get some coffee. You want some?

294
00:13:01,530 --> 00:13:04,350
Uh, you're really going to have caffeine in front of me

295
00:13:04,350 --> 00:13:06,550
when I'm trying to get my life back on track?

296
00:13:08,110 --> 00:13:10,950
Uh, okay, let's pretend you do have a problem.

297
00:13:10,950 --> 00:13:11,860
- I do. - You don't.

298
00:13:11,860 --> 00:13:13,530
- Yeah, but I do. - No, you don't!

299
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:15,940
But let's say you do.

300
00:13:15,940 --> 00:13:17,900
And don't say you do, because you don't!

301
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:21,930
Now, wouldn't you think that throwing yourself

302
00:13:21,930 --> 00:13:24,740
into your work would be the best way to deal with it?

303
00:13:24,740 --> 00:13:26,900
- With what? - Your problem.

304
00:13:26,900 --> 00:13:29,020
I thought I didn't have a problem.

305
00:13:33,490 --> 00:13:35,560
That was painful to watch.

306
00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:41,090
So where are we going?

307
00:13:41,090 --> 00:13:42,130
I don't know.

308
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:43,810
Okay.

309
00:13:43,810 --> 00:13:46,480
How Thelma and Louise of us.

311
00:13:47,670 --> 00:13:50,500
Raj, why don't I care about anything?

312
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:51,590
I'm sorry?

313
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:53,510
It's my baby.

314
00:13:53,510 --> 00:13:55,740
I-I should care about nurseries and colors,

315
00:13:55,740 --> 00:13:58,340
and I don't-- what's wrong with me?

316
00:13:58,340 --> 00:14:02,740
Well, crime-scene photos near your crib spring to mind.

317
00:14:03,090 --> 00:14:04,670
I keep waiting to feel excited,

318
00:14:04,670 --> 00:14:06,570
but it's not happening.

319
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:09,390
What if it never happens?

320
00:14:09,390 --> 00:14:11,450
Bernadette, come on, look,

321
00:14:11,450 --> 00:14:13,890
you're overthinking this, okay?

322
00:14:13,890 --> 00:14:15,840
You're gonna be an amazing mom.

323
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:17,080
Even if you don't believe it,

324
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:19,790
I know you have maternal instincts.

325
00:14:19,790 --> 00:14:22,220
Once, I was supposed to babysit my brothers.

326
00:14:22,220 --> 00:14:25,730
Our neighbor found them naked in the backyard eating crickets.

327
00:14:27,370 --> 00:14:28,860
Happy and well-fed.

328
00:14:28,860 --> 00:14:31,480
You see, that's what I'm taking from that story.

329
00:14:36,190 --> 00:14:38,060
Leonard, can I ask you a question?

330
00:14:38,060 --> 00:14:40,760
Is it about the rotational symmetries you should be figuring out

331
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:43,060
or your fake caffeine problem?

332
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:47,140
Howard, can I ask you a question?

333
00:14:47,940 --> 00:14:48,520
No.

334
00:14:50,430 --> 00:14:52,090
All right, I'll just toss this out to the room.

335
00:14:52,090 --> 00:14:54,260
Um, I was thinking that the best way

336
00:14:54,260 --> 00:14:57,860
to fight my addiction is by weaning myself off in steps.

337
00:14:57,860 --> 00:15:00,310
Now, I couldn't find a caffeine patch,

338
00:15:00,310 --> 00:15:02,450
but I did find what claims to be

339
00:15:02,450 --> 00:15:05,960
a mind-boosting caffeine suppository.

340
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:07,270
Yeah.

341
00:15:07,630 --> 00:15:09,630
You know, the interesting fact about the rectum...

342
00:15:09,630 --> 00:15:11,030
Sheldon!

343
00:15:12,550 --> 00:15:15,020
We are dealing with an impossible deadline

344
00:15:15,020 --> 00:15:16,600
from the Air Force because of you.

345
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:19,440
So have an energy drink, don't have an energy drink.

346
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:21,320
Order suppositories and shove 'em wherever you want,

347
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:22,690
I don't care!

348
00:15:25,140 --> 00:15:26,090
You don't shove them.

349
00:15:26,090 --> 00:15:29,260
They come with an easy-glide applicator.

350
00:15:31,370 --> 00:15:33,200
Right. Listen to me.

351
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:35,470
We can't do anything until you do your part.

352
00:15:35,470 --> 00:15:38,420
So get up in front of this whiteboard and do it!

353
00:15:38,420 --> 00:15:40,320
- I can't. - Yes, you can.

354
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:41,300
No...

355
00:15:42,030 --> 00:15:44,400
I can't figure out the math.

356
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:46,410
I've been racking my brain for days,

357
00:15:46,410 --> 00:15:48,520
and I've got nothing.

358
00:15:49,870 --> 00:15:51,010
Seriously?

359
00:15:51,010 --> 00:15:52,350
I can't do it.

360
00:15:52,350 --> 00:15:54,760
I'm not as smart as I think I am.

361
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:58,340
I'm so sorry. This is all my fault.

362
00:16:01,790 --> 00:16:03,990
It's okay, we'll figure something out.

363
00:16:03,990 --> 00:16:05,830
But what if we can't?

364
00:16:06,610 --> 00:16:08,300
It'll be fine.

365
00:16:08,860 --> 00:16:10,310
You'll see.

366
00:16:15,310 --> 00:16:16,750
Sheldon?

367
00:16:19,100 --> 00:16:20,620
Buddy?

368
00:16:27,190 --> 00:16:28,280
When the baby gets here,

369
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:30,740
you gotta teach me that.

370
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:36,700
Thank you so much, Bert. This was great.

371
00:16:36,700 --> 00:16:37,990
My pleasure.

372
00:16:37,990 --> 00:16:39,130
You girls want to take home

373
00:16:39,130 --> 00:16:41,900
a two-gallon tub of potato salad?

374
00:16:43,130 --> 00:16:44,130
I think we're good.

375
00:16:44,890 --> 00:16:47,540
Okay, well, thanks for coming by.

376
00:16:47,540 --> 00:16:48,990
You're nice people.

377
00:16:48,990 --> 00:16:51,630
Well, so are you. In fact, you know what?

378
00:16:51,630 --> 00:16:54,520
We will never take you for granite.

379
00:16:54,930 --> 00:16:57,540
Did you get that? Granite?

380
00:16:57,540 --> 00:17:00,020
A little geology joke.

381
00:17:01,230 --> 00:17:02,150
You need to leave.

382
00:17:02,150 --> 00:17:03,530
I'm in love with both of you now.

383
00:17:03,530 --> 00:17:04,680
- Okay. - Bye.

384
00:17:08,750 --> 00:17:10,000
Uh, pull over.

385
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,440
What? Why? Who are you calling?

386
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:14,060
You're gonna rat me out to Howard, aren't you?

387
00:17:14,060 --> 00:17:17,740
You're such a snitch, no wonder I don't like you.

388
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:21,580
Whoa, I'm calling my dad, okay?

389
00:17:21,580 --> 00:17:23,730
He's got experience dealing with pregnant ladies

390
00:17:23,730 --> 00:17:25,650
because he's an OBGYN.

391
00:17:25,650 --> 00:17:26,920
And experience with crazy ladies

392
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:28,570
because of my mom.

393
00:17:30,660 --> 00:17:32,230
Hello, Rajesh.

394
00:17:32,230 --> 00:17:33,830
Are you calling to ask for money?

395
00:17:33,830 --> 00:17:34,660
What? No.

396
00:17:34,660 --> 00:17:36,820
Are you calling to ask for things that cost money?

397
00:17:36,820 --> 00:17:37,750
No.

398
00:17:37,750 --> 00:17:39,670
Great. What's up?

399
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:42,200
This is my friend, Bernadette.

400
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:44,540
She's pregnant, and she's a bit worried,

401
00:17:44,540 --> 00:17:46,140
so I thought maybe you could talk to her.

402
00:17:46,140 --> 00:17:48,580
Of course. What seems to be the trouble?

403
00:17:48,580 --> 00:17:50,090
Something's wrong.

404
00:17:50,090 --> 00:17:52,140
I don't care about any of the baby stuff

405
00:17:52,140 --> 00:17:54,550
every other mom is so into.

406
00:17:54,550 --> 00:17:57,470
Honestly, I'm not even sure I like babies.

407
00:17:57,470 --> 00:17:59,940
Look, some people are baby people,

408
00:17:59,940 --> 00:18:02,110
and some people are not baby people.

409
00:18:02,110 --> 00:18:04,740
It doesn't mean you won't love your own baby.

410
00:18:04,740 --> 00:18:07,510
But I thought I'd be more excited.

411
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:10,790
Oh, being excited isn't a guarantee of anything.

412
00:18:10,790 --> 00:18:14,280
Rajesh's mother was thrilled when she was pregnant with him.

413
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:17,290
After he was born, she doted on his every move.

414
00:18:17,290 --> 00:18:18,700
And you know what happened?

415
00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:20,890
He broke her heart, moved halfway around the world,

416
00:18:20,890 --> 00:18:23,370
and dates only poor white women.

417
00:18:25,060 --> 00:18:27,470
So you never know.

418
00:18:28,610 --> 00:18:30,440
Thank you. I feel better now.

419
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:32,560
- I don't! - Good.

420
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:35,220
Bernadette, I hope you have a daughter.

421
00:18:44,210 --> 00:18:46,910
Uh...I don't know how to say this.

422
00:18:46,910 --> 00:18:49,400
Well, you could try starting with "sir".

423
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:51,160
Right. Sorry, sir.

424
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:54,130
He said start with it, not end with it.

425
00:18:55,450 --> 00:18:56,780
Sir...

426
00:18:56,780 --> 00:18:58,650
We've hit a bit of a snag.

427
00:18:58,650 --> 00:19:01,460
We're already behind schedule.

428
00:19:01,460 --> 00:19:03,090
The computations required to

429
00:19:03,090 --> 00:19:05,110
overcome the deployability issues

430
00:19:05,110 --> 00:19:07,530
are more significant than we thought.

431
00:19:07,530 --> 00:19:09,560
I understand that we're under contract,

432
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:12,690
and I don't know what the consequences of violating that are,

433
00:19:12,690 --> 00:19:14,970
but, uh... we're not gonna be able to deliver

434
00:19:14,970 --> 00:19:17,720
in the time we promised.

435
00:19:24,110 --> 00:19:26,620
How long do you need?

436
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:31,510
We-We're thinking... two years.

437
00:19:33,940 --> 00:19:35,000
All right.

438
00:19:37,150 --> 00:19:38,350
That's it?

439
00:19:38,350 --> 00:19:39,660
You're okay with that?

440
00:19:39,660 --> 00:19:41,650
You think you're the first government contractor

441
00:19:41,650 --> 00:19:44,000
who isn't gonna deliver on time?

442
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,960
We're still waiting for a big space laser

443
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:48,620
Reagan ordered to beat the commies.

444
00:19:50,350 --> 00:19:51,710
Thanks for understanding, sir.

445
00:19:51,710 --> 00:19:53,340
Yes, thank you so much.

446
00:19:53,340 --> 00:19:55,730
We-We really appreciate it.

447
00:19:57,020 --> 00:19:58,370
All right, pressure's off

448
00:19:58,370 --> 00:19:59,200
Wanna see a movie?

449
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:01,170
Popcorn's on me.
