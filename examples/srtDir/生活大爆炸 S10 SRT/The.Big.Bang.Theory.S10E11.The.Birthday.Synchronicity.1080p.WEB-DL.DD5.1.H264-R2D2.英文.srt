1
00:00:01,430 --> 00:00:03,130
Previously on The Big Bang Theory...

2
00:00:03,230 --> 00:00:05,010
Hey, Stuart. What are you doing here?

3
00:00:05,170 --> 00:00:06,560
Oh, I'm living here again.

4
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:08,360
Do, uh, Howard and Bernadette know?

5
00:00:10,350 --> 00:00:12,640
Or is like a possum in the walls kind of thing?

6
00:00:14,850 --> 00:00:17,300
No. I needed a place to stay,

7
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:18,260
and with the baby coming,

8
00:00:18,260 --> 00:00:20,050
I figured they could use some extra help.

9
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:22,720
Hey, tomorrow, who wants to paint the nursery?

10
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:23,680
I'll do it.

11
00:00:23,900 --> 00:00:25,660
Why do you get to do it? I'm the artist.

12
00:00:25,660 --> 00:00:28,370
Just because you're starving doesn't make you an artist.

13
00:00:29,610 --> 00:00:32,070
Just because I look sickly doesn't mean I'm starving.

14
00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:34,400
Howard?

15
00:00:34,870 --> 00:00:36,300
I think I'm in labor.

16
00:00:37,090 --> 00:00:38,580
Oh. Oh, okay. Okay.

17
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:40,400
Uh, uh, uh, I can do this.

18
00:00:40,410 --> 00:00:41,350
We have a plan.

19
00:00:41,810 --> 00:00:43,210
Somebody please tell me the plan!

20
00:00:44,170 --> 00:00:45,090
I'll get the hospital bag.

21
00:00:45,090 --> 00:00:45,840
I'll pull the van up.

22
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:47,030
Meet you outside in two minutes.

23
00:00:47,030 --> 00:00:48,140
Team Baby, go!

24
00:00:52,690 --> 00:00:53,790
Oh, man.

25
00:00:54,110 --> 00:00:55,540
This is really happening.

26
00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:56,910
You doin' okay?

27
00:00:57,140 --> 00:00:58,760
Here comes another contraction.

28
00:00:58,760 --> 00:00:59,940
Let's pick it up!

29
00:01:00,090 --> 00:01:01,470
All right, hold on.

30
00:01:01,470 --> 00:01:03,170
I'm gonna drive like we do in India.

31
00:01:04,700 --> 00:01:07,910
Get out of my way, you syphilitic dogs!

32
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:11,250
Stop that! This isn't India.

33
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:12,450
Fine.

34
00:01:12,910 --> 00:01:16,010
What do one point three billion people know about having babies?

35
00:01:17,330 --> 00:01:19,730
Sorry. I know you were just trying to help.

36
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:21,110
I love you.

37
00:01:21,110 --> 00:01:22,680
I love you, too. We're good.

38
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:51,510
Amy?

39
00:01:52,550 --> 00:01:53,310
Wake up.

40
00:01:53,910 --> 00:01:56,310
Wh... What's wrong?

41
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:57,750
It's midnight.

42
00:01:58,860 --> 00:01:59,790
Happy birthday.

43
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:03,270
Sheldon.

44
00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:10,620
Okay, you can have this back in the morning.

45
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:14,920
This is for you.

46
00:02:15,410 --> 00:02:16,520
I was going to wrap it,

47
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:19,250
but touching Scotch tape gives me the heebie-jeebies.

48
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:22,630
I'll put in on the list with peaches and felt.

49
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:26,650
What is this?

50
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:29,060
A functional MRI of my brain.

51
00:02:30,530 --> 00:02:33,230
I did Sudoku before they took it so I'd be ripped.

52
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:37,170
I love it. Thank you.

53
00:02:37,170 --> 00:02:38,520
And it's not just an MRI.

54
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:40,350
The orbitofrontal cortex is lit up

55
00:02:40,350 --> 00:02:41,870
because I was thinking of you.

56
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:44,060
Sheldon!

57
00:02:48,770 --> 00:02:51,810
We seem to be moving on to the annual coitus portion

58
00:02:51,810 --> 00:02:53,290
of your birthday festivities.

59
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:55,660
Is that okay?

60
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:58,270
I didn't put on my come-hither plaid PJ's for nothing.

61
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:02,840
You hate Scotch tape, but you love Scotch plaid.

62
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:04,260
You are a mystery.

63
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:14,510
Guys, wake up!

64
00:03:14,510 --> 00:03:16,070
Bernadette's having her baby!

65
00:03:16,070 --> 00:03:17,680
Come on, we're going to the hospital!

66
00:03:18,690 --> 00:03:19,940
I guess... I guess we should stop.

67
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:21,710
Yeah. I'm afraid so.

68
00:03:23,660 --> 00:03:25,680
Childbirth, looming coitus?

69
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:27,920
This is a banner night for female genitals.

70
00:03:31,390 --> 00:03:33,070
Now I see three of you.

71
00:03:33,070 --> 00:03:38,270
Do we know the father, or is this some Mamma Mia nonsense?

72
00:03:38,270 --> 00:03:39,300
I'm the father.

73
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:42,340
Okay, Dad, how far apart are the contractions?

74
00:03:42,870 --> 00:03:44,090
No idea. Ask him.

75
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:46,560
12 minutes.

76
00:03:46,730 --> 00:03:49,030
12 minutes? Why are you here?

77
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:51,440
Aren't we supposed to get here an hour and a half early?

78
00:03:51,770 --> 00:03:54,320
This is a hospital, not the airport.

79
00:03:55,890 --> 00:03:57,600
I'm sorry. It's our first time.

80
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:58,680
It's okay.

81
00:03:58,770 --> 00:04:01,130
This little one will be here before you know it.

82
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:02,830
Do we know what we're having?

83
00:04:02,830 --> 00:04:04,560
No, we're keeping it a surprise.

84
00:04:04,570 --> 00:04:06,670
Old school. Nice.

85
00:04:07,310 --> 00:04:09,660
Not that old school. He knows.

86
00:04:10,410 --> 00:04:13,780
You see, I was at the doctor's office,

87
00:04:13,780 --> 00:04:17,310
the folder was right there, so I took a peek.

88
00:04:17,310 --> 00:04:20,640
And talking like this doesn't make it less creepy.

89
00:04:22,210 --> 00:04:23,580
Sweetheart, go home.

90
00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:26,760
Come back when the contractions are five minutes apart for an hour.

91
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:28,180
I'm sorry. That's ambiguous.

92
00:04:28,190 --> 00:04:31,130
Is it five minutes apart starting at the top of the hour,

93
00:04:31,130 --> 00:04:32,510
or five minutes apart starting with the first contraction,

94
00:04:32,510 --> 00:04:35,960
so essentially, like, 65 minutes?

95
00:04:38,350 --> 00:04:39,580
I'm just throwing this out there,

96
00:04:39,580 --> 00:04:43,160
but home births are very popular these days.

97
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:48,540
Sheldon, what took you so long?

98
00:04:48,550 --> 00:04:50,380
Wolowitz might hand out cigars.

99
00:04:50,380 --> 00:04:51,930
I had to find my bubble gum cigar

100
00:04:51,930 --> 00:04:53,880
so I could join in without looking foolish.

101
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:57,040
Damn, I need my inhaler.

102
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:57,980
Just don't smoke.

103
00:04:57,980 --> 00:04:59,680
No, I went down the stairs too fast.

104
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:05,060
Don't come to the hospital. We're headed home.

105
00:05:05,150 --> 00:05:07,530
Oh, that was fast. Did she sneeze the baby out?

106
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:11,320
We showed up too early. We'll keep you posted.

107
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:13,780
Okay, well, we'll talk to you guys later. Bye.

108
00:05:14,330 --> 00:05:16,390
She said not to come. It's gonna be a while.

109
00:05:16,940 --> 00:05:19,000
Well, first deliveries can be slow.

110
00:05:19,410 --> 00:05:22,290
I am starting to rethink the Flash onesie I bought this kid.

111
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:25,610
I found it, but it's empty.

112
00:05:25,610 --> 00:05:27,470
Well, it doesn't matter. We're not going to the hospital now.

113
00:05:27,470 --> 00:05:29,300
Are you sure? I'd really like to.

114
00:05:32,070 --> 00:05:35,410
Well, should we, uh, head back up?

115
00:05:36,260 --> 00:05:36,720
Come on, guys.

116
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:38,860
We're all awake. Why don't we go to a diner or something?

117
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:41,160
Oh, uh, I don't know.

118
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:43,260
Sheldon, you don't want to do that, do you?

119
00:05:43,940 --> 00:05:45,360
It doesn't matter what I want.

120
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:47,900
- It's your birthday. You decide. - Oh, my God!

121
00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:49,990
It's your birthday! Let's do something fun.

122
00:05:50,670 --> 00:05:51,790
Well, we could go to a bar.

123
00:05:51,790 --> 00:05:52,930
Well...

124
00:05:54,140 --> 00:05:56,320
Okay, I can breathe again. Babe, they want to have sex.

125
00:05:57,810 --> 00:05:59,140
Oh, of course!

126
00:05:59,150 --> 00:06:02,100
The annual birthday booty spectacular!

127
00:06:03,010 --> 00:06:04,750
That's a bit childish, isn't it?

128
00:06:04,750 --> 00:06:07,680
I'm sorry, and what flavor is your bubble gum cigar?

129
00:06:09,670 --> 00:06:11,710
Grape. I find it the most mild.

130
00:06:13,270 --> 00:06:15,510
All right, well, you two go have fun.

131
00:06:19,190 --> 00:06:22,210
If we find my backup inhaler, maybe we can get frisky.

132
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:25,920
Oh, you sexy, wheezy little man.

133
00:06:28,890 --> 00:06:30,630
Do you really need to record this?

134
00:06:30,630 --> 00:06:32,920
You'll be happy I did.

135
00:06:33,750 --> 00:06:37,110
Okay, little one, here we are back at home

136
00:06:37,110 --> 00:06:39,510
because you weren't quite ready to come out yet.

137
00:06:39,540 --> 00:06:42,090
You wanted to make an entrance. I get it.

138
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:47,870
And here's your daddy.

139
00:06:47,870 --> 00:06:50,140
When he tries to tell you he used to be cool,

140
00:06:50,140 --> 00:06:52,600
you can see he wasn't.

141
00:06:55,170 --> 00:06:57,040
All right, enough with the camera.

142
00:06:57,150 --> 00:06:59,280
Well, this is not for me. This is for the baby.

143
00:06:59,290 --> 00:07:01,260
Some day she's gonna want to see this.

144
00:07:02,140 --> 00:07:03,100
I'm sorry.

145
00:07:04,070 --> 00:07:05,530
Who's gonna want to see this?

146
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:09,760
I-I said she,

147
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:11,860
but lots of things are she --

148
00:07:12,130 --> 00:07:13,940
boats and cars,

149
00:07:13,940 --> 00:07:17,130
whales. Like, thar she blows.

150
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:20,360
You're doing great.

151
00:07:21,970 --> 00:07:22,870
Raj!

152
00:07:22,870 --> 00:07:24,870
Well, okay, I'm gonna sign off now.

153
00:07:24,870 --> 00:07:27,470
This next part may contain some adult language.

154
00:07:28,270 --> 00:07:29,120
How could you?!

155
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:30,980
We made it this far without knowing,

156
00:07:30,980 --> 00:07:32,030
and you ruined it!

157
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:33,730
Well, you guys have no idea how hard it is

158
00:07:33,730 --> 00:07:36,270
to know something like this and not say it!

159
00:07:36,780 --> 00:07:38,900
You told me it was a girl, and I didn't say it.

160
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:41,910
- Raj! - You were supposed to keep that to yourself.

161
00:07:42,610 --> 00:07:45,670
Oh, yeah. I guess it is hard.

162
00:07:50,420 --> 00:07:52,520
So... where were we?

163
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:54,920
Well, I believe

164
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:57,750
we were kissing like randy teenagers,

165
00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:01,890
and your nose was whistling ever so slightly.

166
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:04,220
I'm sorry.

167
00:08:04,220 --> 00:08:05,180
Oh, don't be.

168
00:08:05,330 --> 00:08:07,790
You were like a foxy tea kettle.

169
00:08:09,850 --> 00:08:12,420
Well, shall we start over?

170
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:14,220
Very well.

171
00:08:21,070 --> 00:08:21,970
What's wrong?

172
00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:23,830
I'm not sure.

173
00:08:24,610 --> 00:08:26,550
Earlier tonight, things began organically,

174
00:08:26,550 --> 00:08:28,710
and now it's feeling forced,

175
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:31,710
like all the Pirates of the Caribbean sequels.

176
00:08:34,660 --> 00:08:36,250
Okay, that makes sense.

177
00:08:36,250 --> 00:08:38,280
I mean, the mood's a little different now.

178
00:08:38,850 --> 00:08:40,320
We-we don't have to rush.

179
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:41,200
Oh, I know,

180
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:43,510
but Leonard and Penny think we're doing it,

181
00:08:43,510 --> 00:08:45,100
and I don't want to disappoint them.

182
00:08:48,430 --> 00:08:50,210
And the mood continues to change.

183
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:53,200
No, and also, I don't want to disappoint you. I...

184
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:55,350
You know, come on. It's your birthday.

185
00:08:55,350 --> 00:08:56,870
I can soldier through this.

186
00:08:59,040 --> 00:08:59,990
H-Hold on.

187
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:02,680
I think I might have a little surprise

188
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:06,610
that might help get things back on track.

189
00:09:07,970 --> 00:09:09,290
Intriguing.

190
00:09:09,380 --> 00:09:11,500
Is back on track a hint

191
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:13,780
that it has something to do with trains?

192
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:17,010
No.

193
00:09:18,900 --> 00:09:20,380
Because if it did have to do with trains,

194
00:09:20,380 --> 00:09:21,660
- and you were gonna give... - It's not about trains!

195
00:09:23,870 --> 00:09:25,420
Oh. Not even a cozy sleeper car on the Orient Express...

196
00:09:25,420 --> 00:09:26,780
Stop talking about trains!

197
00:09:28,850 --> 00:09:30,370
Who's killing the mood now?

198
00:09:33,570 --> 00:09:35,560
Found the backup inhaler. Want to have sex?

199
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:40,190
Well, I didn't until I heard that.

200
00:09:40,990 --> 00:09:42,250
Hang on. I'm counting.

201
00:09:44,730 --> 00:09:45,590
It's okay. Mm.

202
00:09:49,420 --> 00:09:50,930
Hello!

203
00:09:50,930 --> 00:09:52,500
Howard and Bernadette kicked me out

204
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:55,190
because I told them they're having a girl!

205
00:09:55,780 --> 00:09:58,110
Oopsy, I did it again.

206
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:02,330
Maybe if we're quiet, he'll go away.

207
00:10:02,670 --> 00:10:05,960
You're gonna have to be quieter than that.

208
00:10:07,850 --> 00:10:08,950
Can I look yet?

209
00:10:09,230 --> 00:10:10,400
One second.

210
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:14,200
All right, you can open your eyes.

211
00:10:20,130 --> 00:10:22,150
I thought I'd let Harry Potter

212
00:10:22,250 --> 00:10:23,890
make things hotter.

213
00:10:27,790 --> 00:10:28,880
Wowza.

214
00:10:31,570 --> 00:10:33,770
I got a Gryffindor robe for you.

215
00:10:34,950 --> 00:10:38,020
A Gryffindor sleeping with a Hufflepuff?

216
00:10:39,210 --> 00:10:41,020
How scandalous.

217
00:10:43,570 --> 00:10:45,590
You naughty girl.

218
00:10:46,450 --> 00:10:50,590
You went to the Wizarding World theme park without me.

219
00:10:50,770 --> 00:10:51,880
I did.

220
00:10:52,130 --> 00:10:53,660
Am I in trouble?

221
00:10:55,530 --> 00:10:56,450
Yes, you're in trouble --

222
00:10:56,450 --> 00:10:58,530
you went to Wizarding World without me!

223
00:10:59,620 --> 00:11:01,220
Wait, what just happened?

224
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:03,400
You know I've been wanting to go.

225
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:05,940
Sheldon, do you really want to argue with me

226
00:11:05,940 --> 00:11:07,370
on my birthday?

227
00:11:08,830 --> 00:11:09,760
Oh, you're right.

228
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:11,410
I'm sorry.

229
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:16,300
Ooh. Happy birthday to me.

230
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:23,700
Hello...

231
00:11:26,460 --> 00:11:27,550
Is this about the baby?

232
00:11:28,460 --> 00:11:31,270
No. People just keep kicking me out everywhere I go.

233
00:11:31,270 --> 00:11:32,660
Good. Then you're used to this.

234
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:36,420
Hey, Bernadette's water broke!

235
00:11:36,420 --> 00:11:37,960
Come on! Everyone to the hospital!

236
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:40,140
You have got to be kidding me!

237
00:11:45,410 --> 00:11:47,810
Just try to relax. We'll be there any minute.

238
00:11:48,330 --> 00:11:50,010
Stuart, stop driving like an old man.

239
00:11:50,010 --> 00:11:51,050
Speed it up a little.

240
00:11:51,050 --> 00:11:52,650
I'm not an old man!

241
00:11:52,940 --> 00:11:54,700
I just can't see at night.

242
00:11:56,610 --> 00:11:57,880
Here comes another one.

243
00:11:57,880 --> 00:12:00,530
Hey, Squinty, the gas pedal's on the right!

244
00:12:01,430 --> 00:12:02,870
All right, hang on.

245
00:12:02,900 --> 00:12:05,160
If you see any pedestrians, just call 'em out.

246
00:12:09,430 --> 00:12:10,420
Howard and Bernadette's kid

247
00:12:10,420 --> 00:12:11,790
might be born on your birthday.

248
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:13,060
How cool is that?

249
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:15,260
Yeah, but I thought this baby was supposed to ruin

250
00:12:15,260 --> 00:12:17,090
their sex life, not mine.

251
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:20,250
This is not how I imagined this day going --

252
00:12:20,250 --> 00:12:22,150
I should be with them right now.

253
00:12:22,150 --> 00:12:23,840
Well, it is their child.

254
00:12:23,980 --> 00:12:25,060
I know that.

255
00:12:25,060 --> 00:12:26,890
But to be fair, I've spent nine months

256
00:12:26,900 --> 00:12:29,380
helping Bernadette get ready for this baby.

257
00:12:29,570 --> 00:12:31,690
And Howard spent five minutes conceiving it.

258
00:12:32,510 --> 00:12:34,040
And I'm being generous.

259
00:12:35,740 --> 00:12:37,130
Five minutes?

260
00:12:37,580 --> 00:12:38,610
We must be doing it wrong.

261
00:12:38,610 --> 00:12:40,320
It took us hours.

262
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:46,260
And-and the worst part is

263
00:12:46,260 --> 00:12:49,130
that they kicked me out and let Stuart stay.

264
00:12:49,740 --> 00:12:52,630
I understand, but this is a special day for them.

265
00:12:52,630 --> 00:12:54,220
Can you just try and let it go?

266
00:12:54,590 --> 00:12:55,660
She's right.

267
00:12:55,660 --> 00:12:58,680
You know, I just learned Amy went to a theme park without me,

268
00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:00,640
but I'm not going to ruin her birthday.

269
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:03,640
I'll wait, and ruin 24 individual hours

270
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:05,370
sprinkled throughout the year.

271
00:13:13,420 --> 00:13:16,040
Deep breaths, slow breaths.

272
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:18,930
I'm so thirsty. Give me more ice chips.

273
00:13:24,930 --> 00:13:28,760
Sorry. I... thought these were room ice chips.

274
00:13:30,270 --> 00:13:31,490
I'll go get some more.

275
00:13:31,850 --> 00:13:33,410
Uh, Stuart, while you're out there,

276
00:13:33,420 --> 00:13:34,390
don't come back.

277
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:36,530
Okay.

278
00:13:39,740 --> 00:13:42,830
So, what are we gonna name this kid?

279
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:45,640
Now that we know she's a girl,

280
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:48,780
it kind of ruins my plan for Wally Wolowitz.

281
00:13:50,490 --> 00:13:52,070
Could name her after your mom.

282
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:53,580
Debbie?

283
00:13:54,330 --> 00:13:55,070
No.

284
00:13:55,070 --> 00:13:56,540
She hated that name.

285
00:13:56,950 --> 00:13:58,150
Did she have a middle name?

286
00:13:58,330 --> 00:13:59,390
Melvina.

287
00:14:01,630 --> 00:14:02,830
Let's keep thinking.

288
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:09,300
It sucks that she's not here.

289
00:14:10,210 --> 00:14:11,520
I know.

290
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:14,470
She would've been the best grandma.

291
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:18,090
She did always have candy in her pocket.

292
00:14:18,590 --> 00:14:19,430
Yeah.

293
00:14:19,770 --> 00:14:22,490
I was 20 years old before I figured out

294
00:14:22,490 --> 00:14:25,250
Tootsie Rolls weren't naturally warm.

295
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:29,670
I didn't know her five minutes and she asked,

296
00:14:29,670 --> 00:14:32,660
Are you a Milky Way or a Snickers girl?

297
00:14:34,940 --> 00:14:37,440
Thank God you answered right, we wouldn't be here today.

298
00:14:40,290 --> 00:14:42,230
It's hard to believe Howard's having a kid.

299
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:43,120
Yeah.

300
00:14:43,260 --> 00:14:45,280
Penny, you're the one who introduced him to Bernie.

301
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:47,240
How many times do I have to say I'm sorry?

302
00:14:49,050 --> 00:14:51,580
It's not just Howard and Bernadette. I mean,

303
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:53,160
look how far we've all come.

304
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:55,390
You two got married.

305
00:14:55,770 --> 00:14:57,480
Sheldon and I are living together.

306
00:14:57,830 --> 00:14:59,980
But if my mom asks, we have bunk beds.

307
00:15:02,290 --> 00:15:04,460
Penny was a struggling actress when we met,

308
00:15:04,460 --> 00:15:07,410
and now she's a successful pharmaceutical rep.

309
00:15:07,430 --> 00:15:09,230
Okay, you don't have to say struggling every time.

310
00:15:09,230 --> 00:15:11,030
You can just say actress.

311
00:15:12,430 --> 00:15:13,870
Howard went to space.

312
00:15:13,870 --> 00:15:15,480
Bernadette got her doctorate.

313
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:18,040
Sheldon, Howard and I are working with the government

314
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:19,810
on our quantum gyroscope.

315
00:15:20,330 --> 00:15:21,770
We've all come a long way.

316
00:15:22,130 --> 00:15:23,620
There's a lot to be proud of.

317
00:15:24,950 --> 00:15:28,610
For God's sake, just drive in the knife, why don't you!

318
00:15:30,740 --> 00:15:32,700
- What's your problem? - Well, you're all thinking

319
00:15:32,700 --> 00:15:35,910
that I'm the only one who hasn't done anything worthwhile.

320
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:37,610
I was not thinking it.

321
00:15:37,610 --> 00:15:40,380
Although, now that you point it out, it is undeniable.

322
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,500
Raj, if it's any consolation,

323
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:46,480
I'm no better off than I was ten years ago.

324
00:15:46,930 --> 00:15:49,120
Oh, yay!

325
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:51,710
I have a doctorate in astrophysics

326
00:15:51,710 --> 00:15:52,850
and I'm every bit as awesome

327
00:15:52,850 --> 00:15:55,280
as the pasty-faced owner of a comic book store!

328
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:58,500
Raj! Show some compassion.

329
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:01,330
Those are things that we think but don't say.

330
00:16:05,570 --> 00:16:06,830
Excuse me.

331
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:09,320
Sorry, Stuart.

332
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:11,740
Hey, I'm in a hospital and I'm not the patient.

333
00:16:12,060 --> 00:16:13,040
I'm fine.

334
00:16:15,230 --> 00:16:16,770
Come on, Bernie, breathe.

335
00:16:16,770 --> 00:16:18,690
Remember what you learned in birthing class.

336
00:16:18,690 --> 00:16:20,720
I remember thinking, this is stupid,

337
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:22,070
and I was right!

338
00:16:23,740 --> 00:16:25,030
Do you want me to get the nurse?

339
00:16:25,030 --> 00:16:28,010
No! If one more person puts their fingers near my uterus,

340
00:16:28,010 --> 00:16:30,600
I'm gonna cross my legs and snap 'em off!

341
00:16:35,620 --> 00:16:38,090
I've come to peace with my relationship with my parents.

342
00:16:38,090 --> 00:16:40,170
That was a big milestone for me.

343
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:42,250
Oh, speaking of personal growth,

344
00:16:42,250 --> 00:16:45,160
I recently tried eating Swiss chard.

345
00:16:47,740 --> 00:16:50,310
You know, I didn't swallow it, but Amy said it counted.

346
00:16:59,250 --> 00:17:01,190
Still a loser or did you turn things around

347
00:17:01,190 --> 00:17:02,590
while you were gone?

348
00:17:05,210 --> 00:17:06,110
You know, Raj, honey,

349
00:17:06,110 --> 00:17:07,560
you're being too hard on yourself.

350
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:09,860
When I first met you, you couldn't even talk to women.

351
00:17:09,860 --> 00:17:12,280
I mean, you couldn't even talk if one was in the room.

352
00:17:12,330 --> 00:17:13,280
Oh, great, now I can say

353
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:15,790
things like I can't believe you're breaking up with me.

354
00:17:16,250 --> 00:17:18,070
Why are you breaking up with me,

355
00:17:18,910 --> 00:17:20,860
Yes, I'll still help you move.

356
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:24,170
Anyone else want to try?

357
00:17:24,230 --> 00:17:26,750
Uh, yeah, I got something.

358
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:28,370
Raj,

359
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:31,540
not everybody could be a dog owner.

360
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:36,340
Oh, what? Did your doggie break up with you too?

361
00:17:38,220 --> 00:17:40,190
Hey, I bought M&Ms at the vending machine

362
00:17:40,190 --> 00:17:41,840
and two bags came out.

363
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:43,450
I bought the first one,

364
00:17:43,450 --> 00:17:44,680
it didn't fall.

365
00:17:45,950 --> 00:17:46,810
Here.

366
00:17:51,660 --> 00:17:53,350
She's here, the baby's here!

367
00:17:53,350 --> 00:17:55,480
Congratulations!

368
00:17:55,630 --> 00:17:56,820
How's Bernadette?

369
00:17:57,030 --> 00:17:58,200
Tired, but great.

370
00:17:58,200 --> 00:17:58,940
They're both great.

371
00:17:58,940 --> 00:18:00,390
Does the baby have a name yet?

372
00:18:00,860 --> 00:18:03,330
We have named her Halley.

373
00:18:03,330 --> 00:18:05,250
Oh, like Halley's comet.

374
00:18:05,260 --> 00:18:05,990
Exactly.

375
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,630
Also like the comet, Bernadette said

376
00:18:07,630 --> 00:18:10,610
she's not gonna have sex with me for another 75 years.

377
00:18:11,660 --> 00:18:13,800
That's not a real thing, he's just joking.

378
00:18:15,090 --> 00:18:16,210
I'm gonna get back.

379
00:18:16,210 --> 00:18:18,360
Thank you for staying up, I can't wait for Halley to meet

380
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:19,900
her new aunts and uncles

381
00:18:19,910 --> 00:18:21,820
and godfather.

382
00:18:23,180 --> 00:18:24,070
Really?

383
00:18:24,070 --> 00:18:25,020
Of course.

384
00:18:26,510 --> 00:18:27,500
You hear that, Stuart?!

385
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:30,550
I've got a dog and a godchild, you have nothing!

386
00:18:37,260 --> 00:18:40,130
Oh, look at all the babies!

387
00:18:40,650 --> 00:18:42,470
Some will be successful,

388
00:18:42,620 --> 00:18:44,380
some may be homeless.

389
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:48,560
It's fun to think about.

390
00:18:51,630 --> 00:18:53,250
I wonder which one's Halley.

391
00:18:53,370 --> 00:18:55,030
Kind of hard to see the names.

392
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:57,320
Mm, that one kind of looks like Bernadette.

393
00:18:57,530 --> 00:18:59,000
They all look the same to me.

394
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:00,070
Guys,

395
00:19:00,070 --> 00:19:01,740
she's my goddaughter,

396
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:03,940
I think I'll know when I see her.

397
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:15,570
That one.

398
00:19:21,860 --> 00:19:23,250
Well, that was quite a day.

399
00:19:23,310 --> 00:19:24,710
It was.

400
00:19:25,270 --> 00:19:26,840
Bernadette had her baby,

401
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:28,890
I made it to Wizarding World,

402
00:19:28,890 --> 00:19:32,550
and now it is time to complete your birthday celebration.

403
00:19:33,090 --> 00:19:33,940
Hankius

404
00:19:33,940 --> 00:19:35,160
pankius.

405
00:19:37,910 --> 00:19:40,170
I was afraid you'd be too tired.

406
00:19:40,310 --> 00:19:43,470
Amy, I just saw a magic train

407
00:19:43,470 --> 00:19:46,170
and reported somebody for cutting the line.

408
00:19:48,180 --> 00:19:51,980
If that's not foreplay, I don't know what is.
