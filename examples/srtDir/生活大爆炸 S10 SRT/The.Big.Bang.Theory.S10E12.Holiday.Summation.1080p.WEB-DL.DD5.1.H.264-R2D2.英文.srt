1
00:00:03,460 --> 00:00:05,060
Hey, can you help me put some of the food out?

2
00:00:05,060 --> 00:00:06,960
Yeah. Let me finish packing this stuff up.

3
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:09,110
You know how Sheldon is if he sees Christmas stuff

4
00:00:09,110 --> 00:00:10,790
lying around after New Year's.

5
00:00:10,790 --> 00:00:12,440
Yeah, but he doesn't live here anymore.

6
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:14,720
Well, he doesn't live at Walmart, but he still threw

7
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:18,580
a tantrum when he saw Marshmallow Peeps after Easter.

8
00:00:19,090 --> 00:00:20,780
And that's the same man who complains

9
00:00:20,780 --> 00:00:24,150
you can't find Marshmallow Peeps after Easter.

10
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:28,050
Oh. It's Bernadette. She says they're running late.

11
00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:29,490
"The baby threw up on Howard,

12
00:00:29,490 --> 00:00:32,240
and then Howard threw up on Howard."

13
00:00:33,150 --> 00:00:35,900
Well, he didn't throw up on the baby. That's a win.

14
00:00:36,850 --> 00:00:37,940
- Hello. - Hi.

15
00:00:37,940 --> 00:00:40,020
Hi! Welcome back. How was Texas?

16
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:42,630
Oh, you know. The Lone Star state.

17
00:00:42,630 --> 00:00:44,960
That should be its Yelp rating.

18
00:00:45,630 --> 00:00:47,110
It was not a great trip.

19
00:00:47,110 --> 00:00:48,260
Well, you're home now.

20
00:00:48,260 --> 00:00:49,790
Yeah. It is good to be home.

21
00:00:49,790 --> 00:00:52,920
I... Oh, good Lord! Is that mistletoe?

22
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:55,850
Don't you maniacs own a calendar?

23
00:00:55,850 --> 00:00:59,030
I told him to take it down. He would not listen to me.

24
00:01:25,830 --> 00:01:27,750
Did you at least have a good flight down there?

25
00:01:27,750 --> 00:01:28,710
It was fine.

26
00:01:28,710 --> 00:01:31,180
Other than the weird-tasting juice Amy gave me.

27
00:01:31,180 --> 00:01:33,730
I slept the whole way.

28
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:36,640
So, what happened in Texas that was so bad?

29
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:38,220
And before our next drive to Comic-Con,

30
00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:40,810
I need the name of that juice.

31
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:44,900
Well, we were on our way to my mother's house...

32
00:01:47,330 --> 00:01:49,690
How did we get in the car?

33
00:01:50,730 --> 00:01:52,290
Hold on.

34
00:01:52,290 --> 00:01:54,580
How did you get him in the car?

35
00:01:54,580 --> 00:01:56,210
I rented one of those carts,

36
00:01:56,210 --> 00:01:57,620
pushed him toward the open door

37
00:01:57,620 --> 00:02:00,610
and just let inertia take care of the rest.

38
00:02:04,070 --> 00:02:05,580
So, while we're at your mother's house,

39
00:02:05,580 --> 00:02:09,370
it might be a good time to tell her that we're living together.

40
00:02:09,370 --> 00:02:11,430
Do we have to?

41
00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:14,410
I really don't want to hear the religious lecture.

42
00:02:14,410 --> 00:02:16,180
Maybe there won't be one.

43
00:02:16,490 --> 00:02:18,540
There's always one.

44
00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:20,920
She gave it to my sister about her boyfriend,

45
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:22,870
my brother about his girlfriend,

46
00:02:22,870 --> 00:02:25,560
my father about his girlfriend.

47
00:02:26,850 --> 00:02:30,140
That one had some un-Christian words in it.

48
00:02:30,990 --> 00:02:32,580
Well, she likes me.

49
00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:35,290
You know, there's a chance she might be okay with it.

50
00:02:35,290 --> 00:02:36,760
Eh, I don't know.

51
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:38,920
I am her precious little boy.

52
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:42,060
And you did take my flower.

53
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:47,650
Do boys have flowers?

54
00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:51,860
Who knows what he has down there.

55
00:02:52,730 --> 00:02:54,390
Anyway...

56
00:02:54,390 --> 00:02:56,900
Thank you, God, for the food we are about to receive

57
00:02:56,900 --> 00:02:58,610
and for the nourishment of our bodies

58
00:02:58,610 --> 00:03:00,920
and bless the hands that prepared it.

59
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:02,220
Amen.

60
00:03:03,710 --> 00:03:05,330
Given that your hands prepared it,

61
00:03:05,330 --> 00:03:07,950
isn't that a little self-serving?

62
00:03:08,570 --> 00:03:10,220
You start changing the words to the prayers,

63
00:03:10,220 --> 00:03:14,540
next thing you know, you're in a church with a guitar.

64
00:03:16,390 --> 00:03:18,130
Thank you for cooking, it looks delicious.

65
00:03:18,130 --> 00:03:19,510
Oh, it's my pleasure. Mm.

66
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:21,830
I'm so glad y'all could make it.

67
00:03:21,830 --> 00:03:24,050
So, tell me, what's going on back home?

68
00:03:24,050 --> 00:03:27,220
Well, uh, Howard and Bernadette had their baby.

69
00:03:27,220 --> 00:03:29,430
Oh, that's wonderful!

70
00:03:29,430 --> 00:03:34,360
Now, have they decided to raise it Jewish or regular?

71
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:40,710
Welcome to Texas.

72
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:44,030
They haven't said.

73
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:48,930
Anyway, we, uh, we also have some exciting news to share.

74
00:03:49,250 --> 00:03:51,210
Oh, wait, wait... I... Shouldn't we just eat?

75
00:03:51,210 --> 00:03:53,330
You know, I mean, God did take time out of his busy schedule

76
00:03:53,330 --> 00:03:55,800
to bless these Sloppy Joes.

77
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:58,690
Come on, Shelly, tell me your news.

78
00:03:58,690 --> 00:04:01,160
All right. This is on you.

79
00:04:02,090 --> 00:04:05,100
Amy and I are living together in sin,

80
00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:08,180
like a couple of New Yorkers.

81
00:04:08,570 --> 00:04:11,880
Now, while you scold us, I'm going to get a knife and a fork.

82
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:14,930
Joe may be sloppy, but Sheldon's not.

83
00:04:16,370 --> 00:04:18,290
Well, thank you for letting me know,

84
00:04:18,290 --> 00:04:22,520
and I, for one, am thrilled.

85
00:04:23,740 --> 00:04:24,780
What?

86
00:04:25,710 --> 00:04:27,730
What... Where's the judgment?

87
00:04:27,730 --> 00:04:30,290
W-Where's the fire and brimstone?

88
00:04:30,290 --> 00:04:31,990
Where's the part where you tell us we're going to Hell

89
00:04:31,990 --> 00:04:33,850
and I say have you seen the size of the bugs outside?

90
00:04:33,850 --> 00:04:35,540
We're already there!

91
00:04:36,570 --> 00:04:38,140
Obviously, I would prefer

92
00:04:38,140 --> 00:04:39,480
if you weren't living out of wedlock,

93
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:41,550
but given your special circumstances,

94
00:04:41,550 --> 00:04:45,150
I'm very happy for you.

95
00:04:46,610 --> 00:04:50,470
And what "special circumstances" are those?

96
00:04:50,470 --> 00:04:54,640
Oh, boy, I think it's about to get bad.

97
00:04:55,570 --> 00:04:57,640
Shelly, how do I put this?

98
00:04:57,640 --> 00:05:00,190
By your third birthday, you had memorized

99
00:05:00,190 --> 00:05:03,570
over a thousand different kinds of trains,

100
00:05:03,570 --> 00:05:05,250
and I never imagined

101
00:05:05,250 --> 00:05:10,130
a woman getting aboard any of them.

102
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:15,740
What, so... You thought I was going to be alone

103
00:05:15,740 --> 00:05:17,280
for the rest of my life?

104
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:19,870
No! Just for the middle part.

105
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:23,760
'Cause at the end I assumed there'd be nurses.

106
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,320
Well, this is highly insulting.

107
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:29,000
Sheldon, don't overreact.

108
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,990
I'm the child she was worried about?

109
00:05:30,990 --> 00:05:32,350
I have a brother and sister

110
00:05:32,350 --> 00:05:34,010
whose combined intellectual wattage

111
00:05:34,010 --> 00:05:36,380
couldn't power a potato clock,

112
00:05:36,380 --> 00:05:38,600
if I spotted them the potato.

113
00:05:41,430 --> 00:05:43,060
Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

114
00:05:43,060 --> 00:05:46,260
Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

115
00:05:46,270 --> 00:05:47,290
What?

116
00:05:47,290 --> 00:05:48,550
Well, I was in my room,

117
00:05:48,550 --> 00:05:50,890
I couldn't hear what they were saying.

118
00:05:53,310 --> 00:05:55,550
I'll take over from here.

119
00:05:55,550 --> 00:05:58,350
He's been in there a long time.

120
00:05:58,910 --> 00:06:00,740
Should I go talk to him?

121
00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:04,310
He's upset with me. I should be the one who talks to him.

122
00:06:07,820 --> 00:06:08,960
Are you going to?

123
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:10,800
Oh, heck no.

124
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:27,780
Sheldon, what... what are you doing?

125
00:06:29,150 --> 00:06:31,400
Just being the un-socialized eccentric

126
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:34,060
my mother always thought I was.

127
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:38,040
You startin' to see why I didn't go in there?

128
00:06:39,020 --> 00:06:40,640
Sheldon, if you're trying to prove me wrong,

129
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:44,880
the tighty-whities on your head ain't changing my mind.

130
00:06:45,530 --> 00:06:48,070
We're ignoring the fins... Okay.

131
00:06:48,650 --> 00:06:50,880
Yeah. And I don't understand why you're taking her side.

132
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:52,080
By being my girlfriend,

133
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:54,310
she's saying you're a weirdo, too.

134
00:06:54,310 --> 00:06:56,060
I don't think that's what she's saying.

135
00:06:56,060 --> 00:06:57,620
And...?

136
00:06:57,620 --> 00:07:00,440
That's exactly what she was saying.

137
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:03,960
Can you believe my mother thinks we're both strange?

138
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:06,120
Absolutely not!

139
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:07,190
That's... too loud.

140
00:07:07,190 --> 00:07:09,260
Absolutely not.

141
00:07:10,530 --> 00:07:11,840
Well, after that, Sheldon and I

142
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:13,240
got out of the house for a while.

143
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:15,790
Well, first we buttered my feet to get the swim fins off,

144
00:07:15,790 --> 00:07:17,550
and then we went out.

145
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:21,600
You know, I'm sorry your mother made you feel bad.

146
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:23,730
But, you know, at the end of the day, she was wrong,

147
00:07:23,730 --> 00:07:26,910
because you're not alone.

148
00:07:26,910 --> 00:07:28,480
You're right.

149
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:31,640
I have Leonard and Howard and Raj,

150
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:33,540
Stuart, Penny,

151
00:07:33,540 --> 00:07:36,120
Leonard's mom, Bernadette, Wil Wheaton...

152
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:39,550
What about the woman who just buttered your big flat feet?

153
00:07:41,090 --> 00:07:43,330
I was going chronologically.

154
00:07:43,330 --> 00:07:45,370
You're right between Koothrappali's father

155
00:07:45,370 --> 00:07:48,760
and Omar, the one-eyed Sparkletts guy.

156
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:51,570
Well, let's try to not let it ruin the rest of our trip.

157
00:07:51,570 --> 00:07:52,650
I knew we should've never mentioned

158
00:07:52,650 --> 00:07:55,510
us living together in the first place.

159
00:07:55,510 --> 00:07:57,130
She was gonna find out eventually.

160
00:07:57,130 --> 00:07:58,210
Disagree.

161
00:07:58,210 --> 00:08:00,820
We've known about evolution since 1859.

162
00:08:00,820 --> 00:08:04,920
She still believes in Noah and his amazing zoo boat.

163
00:08:05,530 --> 00:08:06,750
This could have all been avoided

164
00:08:06,750 --> 00:08:09,170
if you'd only listened to me.

165
00:08:09,950 --> 00:08:11,520
Sheldon,

166
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:13,700
I knew your mother was fine with us living together

167
00:08:13,700 --> 00:08:17,240
because I already told her we were.

168
00:08:18,060 --> 00:08:19,370
Why would you do that?

169
00:08:19,370 --> 00:08:21,140
This was a potential issue,

170
00:08:21,140 --> 00:08:22,940
so I got out ahead of it

171
00:08:22,940 --> 00:08:26,280
and I managed the situation for you.

172
00:08:26,850 --> 00:08:29,450
You "managed the situation."

173
00:08:29,450 --> 00:08:30,460
That's right.

174
00:08:30,460 --> 00:08:33,380
So my mother thought I was incapable of finding a mate,

175
00:08:33,380 --> 00:08:37,010
and my mate thinks I'm incapable of running my own life.

176
00:08:37,010 --> 00:08:38,520
Not your whole life!

177
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:40,420
I mean, science. You got that.

178
00:08:40,420 --> 00:08:43,350
Organizing your sock drawer, you're the king.

179
00:08:44,210 --> 00:08:47,030
But understanding how other people are feeling,

180
00:08:47,030 --> 00:08:48,880
that's a weak spot for you.

181
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:51,010
I have gotten much better at that.

182
00:08:51,010 --> 00:08:53,730
Have you? How am I feeling right now?

183
00:08:53,730 --> 00:08:55,870
What the... How should I know?

184
00:08:57,890 --> 00:09:00,780
Excited? Itchy? Give me the first letter.

185
00:09:01,890 --> 00:09:04,010
You and I are in a relationship.

186
00:09:04,010 --> 00:09:05,480
I help you with your shortcomings,

187
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:07,780
and you help me with mine.

188
00:09:07,780 --> 00:09:09,160
How would you feel if I contacted

189
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:11,330
your mother behind your back?

190
00:09:11,330 --> 00:09:14,920
Delighted that you showed any interest in my family at all?

191
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:16,500
"Delighted"?

192
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:19,250
What... Not if I guessed for a hundred years.

193
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:23,380
- Hi. - Hey, guys.

194
00:09:23,380 --> 00:09:25,530
Hi. There's the little family!

195
00:09:25,530 --> 00:09:27,470
- Hello. - Hello.

196
00:09:29,150 --> 00:09:31,060
And their Sherpas.

197
00:09:32,490 --> 00:09:33,280
The baby's asleep,

198
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:34,240
can we put her in your room?

199
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:35,790
- Yeah. Go ahead. - Do you need help?

200
00:09:35,790 --> 00:09:37,620
No. I got it.

201
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,290
Doubtfire, Poppins, follow me.

202
00:09:42,770 --> 00:09:43,950
Sorry we're late.

203
00:09:43,950 --> 00:09:46,250
Oh, it's no problem, Amy and Sheldon were just telling us

204
00:09:46,250 --> 00:09:47,770
about their trip to Texas.

205
00:09:47,770 --> 00:09:48,770
Yeah. Here.

206
00:09:48,770 --> 00:09:50,350
I'll catch you up.

207
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,050
How did we get in the car?

208
00:09:52,050 --> 00:09:53,470
Stop.

209
00:09:55,430 --> 00:09:57,170
Okay. They told Mary they were living together,

210
00:09:57,170 --> 00:09:59,080
there was a fight, he got his feelings hurt,

211
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:00,490
then he put underwear on his head...

212
00:10:00,490 --> 00:10:01,440
On purpose,

213
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:04,270
not the way it used to happen in high school.

214
00:10:05,830 --> 00:10:08,510
I was acting odd intentionally.

215
00:10:08,510 --> 00:10:11,310
Really? So you can control it?

216
00:10:13,620 --> 00:10:15,170
Okay. Then what happened?

217
00:10:15,170 --> 00:10:17,050
Well, there's really not much left to tell.

218
00:10:17,050 --> 00:10:19,660
I decided that my mother views me as a child

219
00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:21,890
because I never went through a rebellious phase,

220
00:10:21,890 --> 00:10:24,520
so, I got an earring.

221
00:10:28,110 --> 00:10:30,050
My mother made me take it out.

222
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:35,500
Amy put alcohol on it.

223
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:41,140
And here we are.

224
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:42,910
What did we miss?

225
00:10:42,910 --> 00:10:45,650
I couldn't explain it if I tried.

226
00:10:50,170 --> 00:10:53,460
So tell me, how did Sheldon look with an earring?

227
00:10:53,460 --> 00:10:57,720
Like the pirate who helps the other pirates connect to the internet?

228
00:10:59,570 --> 00:11:01,150
So what did you and Leonard do?

229
00:11:01,150 --> 00:11:03,480
Actually, we got in a pretty nasty fight.

230
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:05,180
It might've been the worst one we've ever had.

231
00:11:05,180 --> 00:11:06,490
Oh, my God, what happened?

232
00:11:06,490 --> 00:11:10,130
Well, we had started binge-watching Luke Cage together,

233
00:11:10,130 --> 00:11:12,620
and it was kind of our thing, and then,

234
00:11:12,620 --> 00:11:17,050
I find out that she watched two episodes without me.

235
00:11:17,050 --> 00:11:21,450
It's like I was excited for a present and got socks.

236
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:24,130
I don't understand how that turns into

237
00:11:24,130 --> 00:11:25,510
the worst fight of your life.

238
00:11:25,510 --> 00:11:27,890
I don't understand what's wrong with socks.

239
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:29,960
To be fair, we may have been on edge

240
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:32,030
because of the Christmas tree.

241
00:11:32,030 --> 00:11:34,080
What happened with the tree?

242
00:11:39,490 --> 00:11:41,230
You do make a cute elf.

243
00:11:41,230 --> 00:11:42,070
Oh, yeah?

244
00:11:42,070 --> 00:11:45,800
And you thought Spock ears were only good for Comic-Con.

245
00:11:46,430 --> 00:11:47,600
Hey, hey, I just found a farm

246
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:49,920
where they let you chop down your own tree.

247
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:54,960
Oh cool, I'll be like a pointy-eared Paul Bunyan.

248
00:12:02,410 --> 00:12:04,590
Stupid idea.

249
00:12:05,490 --> 00:12:07,490
No, what's stupid is a physicist

250
00:12:07,490 --> 00:12:09,480
who doesn't understand when you swing an axe

251
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:12,580
you don't let go.

252
00:12:13,410 --> 00:12:16,510
For the tenth time, my mittens were slippery!

253
00:12:17,260 --> 00:12:20,360
It's 70 degrees, you didn't need mittens.

254
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:23,820
You know how easily I blister.

255
00:12:23,820 --> 00:12:25,640
Yes, yes, you bruise, you peel.

256
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:28,640
It's like I'm married to an old piece of fruit.

257
00:12:29,530 --> 00:12:31,890
Look, we could keep fighting and let it ruin our night,

258
00:12:31,890 --> 00:12:34,930
or-or we can stop and try to salvage the evening.

259
00:12:34,930 --> 00:12:37,310
- Fine. - Thank you.

260
00:12:44,140 --> 00:12:45,290
Leonard?

261
00:12:45,290 --> 00:12:46,620
Yeah.

262
00:12:46,620 --> 00:12:50,000
There's something on the windshield.

263
00:12:57,500 --> 00:12:59,110
You need a break?

264
00:12:59,110 --> 00:13:00,980
Do not need a break.

265
00:13:00,980 --> 00:13:03,530
There's no shame in asking for a break.

266
00:13:03,530 --> 00:13:05,280
If I need a break, I'll ask for a break!

267
00:13:07,260 --> 00:13:08,190
Leonard?

268
00:13:08,190 --> 00:13:09,560
Yeah?

269
00:13:13,580 --> 00:13:15,680
There's a tree on you.

270
00:13:24,690 --> 00:13:26,120
You want to decorate it tonight?

271
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:28,960
Yeah, with gasoline and a match? Sure.

272
00:13:43,580 --> 00:13:45,590
I hope it kills us both.

273
00:13:47,290 --> 00:13:48,610
By the way, if anyone asks,

274
00:13:48,610 --> 00:13:51,970
the elevator shaft always had a tree in it.

275
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:57,520
So Bernadette, if I express interest in your baby

276
00:13:57,520 --> 00:14:00,060
will you promise not to make me touch it?

277
00:14:00,990 --> 00:14:01,770
Sure.

278
00:14:01,770 --> 00:14:04,700
Hey, how's life with your baby?

279
00:14:05,610 --> 00:14:07,710
Really? You're never gonna touch their baby?

280
00:14:07,710 --> 00:14:10,760
To this day I've never touched Stuart.

281
00:14:15,140 --> 00:14:18,470
It's been wonderful, Sheldon, thanks for asking.

282
00:14:20,180 --> 00:14:22,770
Oh, please stop crying, I'm begging you!

283
00:14:22,770 --> 00:14:24,840
I don't know what else to do!

284
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:28,170
My boobs are empty. Do you want lasagna?

285
00:14:31,550 --> 00:14:35,060
Shh, shh, shh, it's okay, it's okay.

286
00:14:42,510 --> 00:14:44,620
What have we done?

287
00:14:46,180 --> 00:14:50,050
Hey, I found superhero baby wipes,

288
00:14:50,050 --> 00:14:52,590
the perfect way to clean up crime...

289
00:14:52,930 --> 00:14:54,630
and tushies.

290
00:14:57,520 --> 00:15:00,100
It took me two hours to get her down.

291
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:03,420
Oh, you-you relax, I'll take this shift.

292
00:15:04,110 --> 00:15:07,170
You know, in India when my baby brother cried like that,

293
00:15:07,170 --> 00:15:08,760
the servants would just take him far away

294
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:10,900
so we couldn't hear it.

295
00:15:13,430 --> 00:15:16,540
Not always, sometimes we'd leave.

296
00:15:19,270 --> 00:15:21,860
Hey, he got her to stop.

297
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:23,650
That was so fast.

298
00:15:23,650 --> 00:15:25,440
Oh, he's really good with her.

299
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:29,000
Yeah, he has a gift.

300
00:15:30,420 --> 00:15:31,700
What's the matter?

301
00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:34,580
Nothing, these are happy tears.

302
00:15:35,070 --> 00:15:36,460
Oh, good.

303
00:15:36,460 --> 00:15:39,050
No they're not, you bozo!

304
00:15:40,910 --> 00:15:45,460
How come Stuart can get her to stop crying, but I can't?

305
00:15:45,460 --> 00:15:47,630
I mean, it's Stuart.

306
00:15:47,630 --> 00:15:51,880
Maybe she's playing possum until he goes away.

307
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,640
Not funny.

308
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:57,920
She's tired, that was funny.

309
00:15:59,150 --> 00:16:02,070
Everyone's a better mom than me.

310
00:16:02,070 --> 00:16:04,240
Oh, don't take it so personally,

311
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:07,740
maybe your baby's just a jerk.

312
00:16:12,910 --> 00:16:14,590
Wait, so how does the story end?

313
00:16:14,590 --> 00:16:15,910
Is the baby a jerk

314
00:16:15,910 --> 00:16:18,440
or is Bernadette a bad mother?

315
00:16:19,900 --> 00:16:21,010
- Sheldon! - W-What?

316
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:22,890
Is there another twist coming?

317
00:16:22,890 --> 00:16:25,040
Is the baby not theirs at all?

318
00:16:26,450 --> 00:16:27,560
Ignore him.

319
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:29,750
How did you get the baby to stop crying?

320
00:16:29,750 --> 00:16:32,950
Oh, I just talked to her.

321
00:16:32,950 --> 00:16:38,060
I've been told the sound of my voice puts people to sleep.

322
00:16:40,950 --> 00:16:44,060
You poor things, you must be exhausted.

323
00:16:44,060 --> 00:16:47,950
It has been hard to sleep with all the crying.

324
00:16:53,820 --> 00:16:55,590
How can she hate me?

325
00:16:55,590 --> 00:16:59,090
I make her food in my chest!

326
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:05,080
It's like hating a frozen yogurt machine.

327
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:08,470
She doesn't hate you, stop saying that.

328
00:17:08,470 --> 00:17:11,770
Now you hate me too!

329
00:17:11,770 --> 00:17:14,540
Shh, I don't hate you.

330
00:17:27,300 --> 00:17:31,070
It says here that up to 80% of new mothers

331
00:17:31,070 --> 00:17:32,800
experience baby blues.

332
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:34,110
And that the best thing to do

333
00:17:34,110 --> 00:17:37,060
is reassure them that they're doing a good job.

334
00:17:37,060 --> 00:17:38,490
Bernadette,

335
00:17:38,490 --> 00:17:40,970
you are doing a good job.

336
00:17:43,420 --> 00:17:45,950
Thank you, Sheldon, I'm feeling better now.

337
00:17:45,950 --> 00:17:47,450
Thank you, Internet.

338
00:17:47,450 --> 00:17:49,000
I'm telling you, with the right YouTube video,

339
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,580
I can give Howard a vasectomy.

340
00:17:54,460 --> 00:17:56,200
So things started to turn around?

341
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:59,750
Yeah, eventually I figured out how to get the baby to sleep.

342
00:17:59,750 --> 00:18:03,590
Please tell me you didn't use Amy's magic juice.

343
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:12,130
Bernie?

344
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:13,950
She's asleep.

345
00:18:13,950 --> 00:18:14,920
Great.

346
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:18,980
And where are you?

347
00:18:20,250 --> 00:18:22,170
Down here.

348
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:35,890
This is new.

349
00:18:35,890 --> 00:18:37,910
I didn't know what else to do.

350
00:18:37,910 --> 00:18:39,770
It worked.

351
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:42,760
Well, I'd say that's thinking outside the box,

352
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:45,600
but... come on.

353
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:49,710
Don't make me laugh.

354
00:18:52,980 --> 00:18:54,820
Do you need help getting out?

355
00:18:54,820 --> 00:18:57,070
I think I live here now.

356
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:00,950
It's fine.

357
00:19:00,950 --> 00:19:03,060
Is it okay if I get some sleep?

358
00:19:03,060 --> 00:19:05,700
Yeah, go ahead.

359
00:19:09,230 --> 00:19:11,110
Good job, Mommy.

360
00:19:11,910 --> 00:19:14,120
I'm proud of you.

361
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:17,830
Don't make me cry, either.

362
00:19:17,830 --> 00:19:19,550
Good night.

363
00:19:20,490 --> 00:19:22,350
I love both my girls.

364
00:19:22,350 --> 00:19:24,500
We love you, too.

365
00:19:30,790 --> 00:19:32,460
I can't believe you fit in the crib.

366
00:19:32,460 --> 00:19:35,280
I could take a bath in the sink.

367
00:19:36,770 --> 00:19:39,170
I don't, but I can.

368
00:19:40,270 --> 00:19:41,740
So how were your holidays?

369
00:19:41,740 --> 00:19:43,960
Oh, thank you for asking.

370
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:46,690
Uh, I, uh, went to visit my grandmother.

371
00:19:46,690 --> 00:19:49,040
She's in Bakersfield.

372
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:51,730
Uh, usually my brother and sister go...

373
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:56,890
Oh, come on!

374
00:20:01,750 --> 00:20:03,180
That was fun, thank you.

375
00:20:03,180 --> 00:20:04,010
Yeah, thanks.

376
00:20:04,010 --> 00:20:05,590
Our pleasure. See you guys at work.

377
00:20:05,590 --> 00:20:06,920
Be there bright and early.

378
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:08,660
Not me, paternity leave.

379
00:20:09,050 --> 00:20:11,460
A small human wreaks havoc on his wife's genitals

380
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:13,350
and he gets time off.

381
00:20:14,470 --> 00:20:16,280
With pay, sucka!

382
00:20:21,070 --> 00:20:23,290
Forgot the baby, still new to this.

383
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:57,180
