16
00:00:01,850 --> 00:00:02,730
We're pinned down!

17
00:00:02,730 --> 00:00:03,800
We can't get through!

18
00:00:03,800 --> 00:00:05,320
Sheldon, get over here and help!

19
00:00:05,320 --> 00:00:07,340
Okay, one second.

20
00:00:09,350 --> 00:00:11,480
Sheldon, why are you jumping up and down?

21
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:12,810
I'm trying to shoot.

22
00:00:12,810 --> 00:00:14,120
Then use the shoot button,

23
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:17,880
not the "Wonderful thing about Tiggers" button!

24
00:00:19,570 --> 00:00:21,370
That's it, we're dead.

25
00:00:21,370 --> 00:00:22,380
Okay, challenge them again.

26
00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:24,760
Doing it right now.

27
00:00:24,940 --> 00:00:25,870
Oh, they can't.

28
00:00:25,870 --> 00:00:29,900
There's an important Little League game tomorrow.

29
00:00:30,170 --> 00:00:33,440
No wonder they beat us, they're jocks.

30
00:00:33,860 --> 00:00:35,070
What happened to me?

31
00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:37,000
I used to excel at these things.

32
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,010
Kids are always better at video games.

33
00:00:39,010 --> 00:00:40,470
Well, I don't like it.

34
00:00:40,470 --> 00:00:44,470
Mm, if it makes you feel better, you still dress like a child.

35
00:00:44,470 --> 00:00:45,950
No, but it's not just video games.

36
00:00:45,950 --> 00:00:48,850
I downloaded the new O.S. For my phone, took me a week

37
00:00:48,850 --> 00:00:52,640
to stop accidentally texting kissy faces to everyone.

38
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:55,680
Oh, so our love is not real?

39
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:57,830
Well, I-I know how you feel.

40
00:00:57,830 --> 00:01:00,460
I tried one of those electronic Japanese toilets,

41
00:01:00,460 --> 00:01:04,560
practically shot myself across the room.

42
00:01:04,780 --> 00:01:06,140
I guess I just need to face it,

43
00:01:06,140 --> 00:01:07,780
I'm no longer a wunderkind.

44
00:01:07,780 --> 00:01:10,810
Now I just wonder what's for lunch.

45
00:01:10,810 --> 00:01:11,680
Hot dogs.

46
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:41,140
I didn't know you could drink while you're breastfeeding.

47
00:01:41,140 --> 00:01:43,960
Yeah, they say the yeast in beer helps with milk production.

48
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:45,980
I'm pretty sure that's a myth, let me check.

49
00:01:45,980 --> 00:01:50,300
Ruin it for me and I'll break this glass over your head.

50
00:01:50,300 --> 00:01:51,710
To denial.

51
00:01:53,190 --> 00:01:54,900
Oh, I'm gonna get another.

52
00:01:55,010 --> 00:01:55,940
You want food?

53
00:01:55,940 --> 00:01:58,900
Yeah, breastfeeding burns, like, 5,000 calories a day.

54
00:01:58,900 --> 00:02:01,330
Do not touch that phone.

55
00:02:05,220 --> 00:02:06,440
Penny?

56
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:08,100
Oh, Zack. Hey.

57
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:09,800
What are the odds of running into you here?

58
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:12,890
Well, it's a bar, so pretty good.

59
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:14,090
Uh, what's new?

60
00:02:14,090 --> 00:02:15,580
Oh, tons of stuff.

61
00:02:15,580 --> 00:02:18,280
Put artificial grass in my backyard, got engaged,

62
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:21,740
had a scary mole that turned out to be Sharpie.

63
00:02:22,270 --> 00:02:23,790
Well, congratulations.

64
00:02:23,790 --> 00:02:26,400
That's what my dermatologist said.

65
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:28,720
No, on-on getting engaged, good for you.

66
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:30,620
Oh, thanks. How about you?

67
00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:31,540
Hey, how's Leonard?

68
00:02:31,540 --> 00:02:33,220
Is he still smart?

69
00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:35,210
Yes, yes, he's working for the government

70
00:02:35,210 --> 00:02:38,030
on an infinite persistence gyroscope.

71
00:02:38,030 --> 00:02:39,320
Of course, the first time I say it right,

72
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:41,390
he's not even here.

73
00:02:41,390 --> 00:02:42,970
I love that little guy.

74
00:02:42,970 --> 00:02:44,680
Hey, we should all have dinner sometime.

75
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:46,870
Uh, yeah, sure, I'll check with Leonard.

76
00:02:46,870 --> 00:02:49,450
Cool, I'll check with Sara.

77
00:02:49,450 --> 00:02:53,900
Sara, pull up my calendar.

78
00:02:54,490 --> 00:02:57,530
It never works for me.

79
00:02:59,890 --> 00:03:03,660
I've been thinking about our recent humiliation.

80
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:06,190
You're gonna have to be more specific.

81
00:03:06,190 --> 00:03:08,880
At the hands of those teenagers.

82
00:03:09,620 --> 00:03:11,610
More.

83
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:13,940
Boy teenagers.

84
00:03:13,940 --> 00:03:16,810
Oh, the video game. Yeah, that was bad.

85
00:03:16,810 --> 00:03:19,790
I started doing some reading on cognitive vitality,

86
00:03:19,790 --> 00:03:23,610
and I came across an area of research called "Super-aging."

87
00:03:23,610 --> 00:03:25,990
You know who's a super-ager? Jennifer Lopez.

89
00:03:25,990 --> 00:03:28,590
Like, what is her secret?

90
00:03:29,530 --> 00:03:31,020
Now, this is rare.

91
00:03:31,020 --> 00:03:35,510
I don't know which one of you I want to stop talking first.

92
00:03:35,930 --> 00:03:38,740
The theory is that if you really tax your brain,

93
00:03:38,740 --> 00:03:40,630
the neurofibers will become thicker

94
00:03:40,630 --> 00:03:42,790
and the glial cells more lustrous.

95
00:03:42,790 --> 00:03:45,510
Like JLo's hair.

96
00:03:46,010 --> 00:03:49,310
Boy, it is neck and neck right now.

97
00:03:49,310 --> 00:03:50,930
How is super-aging any different

98
00:03:50,930 --> 00:03:52,770
than, like, doing crossword puzzles?

99
00:03:52,770 --> 00:03:54,810
Well, it's not just doing simple cognitive tasks.

100
00:03:54,810 --> 00:03:57,040
You need to push your brain out of its comfort zone

101
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:59,280
and reach mental exhaustion.

102
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:00,520
I drive you to work every day,

103
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:03,710
my brain must look like the Hulk.

104
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:05,770
If you really want to challenge yourself,

105
00:04:05,770 --> 00:04:07,570
you could learn to speak Hindi.

106
00:04:07,570 --> 00:04:11,030
{\an8}Jab mein aat saal ka tha Maine seekha tha.

107
00:04:13,050 --> 00:04:14,080
Could you say that in English?

108
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:17,060
I actually, I never learned Hindi.

109
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:21,320
Hey, you ready to go?

110
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:22,770
Yeah, I guess.

111
00:04:22,770 --> 00:04:24,390
What's the matter?

112
00:04:25,150 --> 00:04:27,880
Honestly? It's a little strange having dinner with your ex-boyfriend,

113
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:29,930
and it's not like we have a lot to talk about.

114
00:04:29,930 --> 00:04:31,640
What? He loves you, okay?

115
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:33,130
And he's interested in your work.

116
00:04:33,130 --> 00:04:36,500
You could talk about the infinite perspective...

117
00:04:36,790 --> 00:04:39,640
I swear I know it.

118
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:41,100
It'll be fine, let's just go.

119
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:42,860
Well, and his fiance will be there, so you know,

120
00:04:42,860 --> 00:04:45,570
if the conversation lags, we can talk about their wedding.

121
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:48,380
Come on, I spent an entire plane ride

122
00:04:48,380 --> 00:04:50,950
with you talking about the trailer for Deadpool 2.

123
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:53,530
I knew you weren't asleep.

124
00:04:55,140 --> 00:04:55,870
Hey, guys.

125
00:04:55,870 --> 00:04:57,840
- Hi. - Hey, where's your fiance?

126
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:00,160
Oh, she couldn't make it. She had an emergency.

127
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:01,680
Oh, no, what happened?

128
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:04,140
I didn't ask.

129
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:11,140
What smells so good?

130
00:05:11,140 --> 00:05:13,860
Raj is teaching me to make croissants.

131
00:05:14,110 --> 00:05:16,120
Is this part of your super-aging?

132
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:18,560
Yes. Yeah, it seemed daunting at first,

133
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:19,450
but then I realized,

134
00:05:19,450 --> 00:05:21,620
it's like the chemistry set I had as a kid.

135
00:05:21,620 --> 00:05:22,900
Only, when your brother eats this,

136
00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:25,570
no one has to call Poison Control.

137
00:05:25,930 --> 00:05:26,620
Okay.

138
00:05:26,620 --> 00:05:28,390
Shall we?

139
00:05:32,350 --> 00:05:33,970
Oh, my God.

140
00:05:33,970 --> 00:05:38,640
It's light, it's flaky, it's buttery.

141
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:42,510
You don't need to have sex with him, just eat one of these.

142
00:05:43,180 --> 00:05:44,950
Yes, it is delicious.

143
00:05:44,950 --> 00:05:47,150
Wha... Physicist, baker, lover,

144
00:05:47,150 --> 00:05:49,360
what can't I do?

145
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:51,600
Well, clearly mental tasks are not enough.

146
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:53,680
Maybe you need to challenge your motor skills.

147
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:58,090
For the last time, I am not having a tickle fight with you.

148
00:05:58,090 --> 00:05:59,480
You want a real challenge,

149
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:02,790
try keeping me from eating more of these.

150
00:06:03,620 --> 00:06:05,620
You're just using food to mask the fear

151
00:06:05,620 --> 00:06:06,690
that you're fundamentally unlovable

152
00:06:06,690 --> 00:06:10,430
and therefore going to be alone forever.

153
00:06:10,830 --> 00:06:13,560
Damn it, he's good at that, too.

154
00:06:16,170 --> 00:06:17,690
Thanks.

155
00:06:17,690 --> 00:06:20,600
Wow, working on a top secret government project,

156
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:22,310
that is so cool.

157
00:06:22,310 --> 00:06:25,250
Do you have a bodyguard to keep spies away?

158
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:29,440
I have Sheldon, that keeps most people away.

159
00:06:29,830 --> 00:06:31,170
I miss that guy.

160
00:06:31,170 --> 00:06:33,000
He's like the Swedish Chef Muppet.

161
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,290
I don't know what he's saying, but he's funny.

162
00:06:36,290 --> 00:06:40,030
Oh, I know what he's saying, and he's not, he's not funny.

163
00:06:40,030 --> 00:06:42,230
So, Penny, what's going on with you?

164
00:06:42,230 --> 00:06:43,220
How's the job?

165
00:06:43,220 --> 00:06:45,710
Uh, it's okay, I'm still in pharmaceutical sales.

166
00:06:45,710 --> 00:06:47,170
She's doing amazing.

167
00:06:47,170 --> 00:06:48,890
She can actually make a side effect,

168
00:06:48,890 --> 00:06:50,960
like 10% chance of liver failure,

169
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:55,210
sound like a 90% chance of liver success.

170
00:06:55,210 --> 00:06:57,520
Yeah, lying isn't my favorite part of the job.

171
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:59,680
Actually, I'm not crazy about a lot of it.

172
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:01,200
Hey, if you're not happy there, I've been looking

173
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:02,870
for a new head of sales at my company.

174
00:07:02,870 --> 00:07:05,210
And we don't sell drugs, just menus,

175
00:07:05,210 --> 00:07:06,350
so the only lie you'll be telling

176
00:07:06,350 --> 00:07:10,250
is we print on recycled paper.

177
00:07:10,620 --> 00:07:13,740
We don't.

178
00:07:14,340 --> 00:07:15,810
Oh, that's a nice offer.

179
00:07:15,810 --> 00:07:17,340
You know, we'd make a great team.

180
00:07:17,340 --> 00:07:19,230
Or as we say in the menu business,

181
00:07:19,230 --> 00:07:24,200
I can't do this without "Me N U."

182
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:26,230
Right, 'cause it spells "Menu."

183
00:07:26,230 --> 00:07:28,540
Yeah, right? It's funny. I got a lot of menu jokes,

184
00:07:28,540 --> 00:07:31,390
but that's my favorite.

185
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:36,820
All right, this is everything.

186
00:07:36,820 --> 00:07:38,290
What do you want to learn?

187
00:07:38,290 --> 00:07:41,450
It really doesn't matter, as long as it's challenging.

188
00:07:41,450 --> 00:07:45,420
Okay, well, how about, oh, I teach you

189
00:07:45,420 --> 00:07:48,730
some close-up... magic.

190
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:51,280
Howard, I'm trying to make myself uncomfortable,

191
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:53,840
not everyone else.

192
00:07:54,830 --> 00:07:56,270
So you wanted to learn something physical

193
00:07:56,270 --> 00:07:59,660
and you came to Howard Wolowitz?

194
00:07:59,660 --> 00:08:04,950
Hey, the circus arts are very physically and mentally demanding.

195
00:08:04,950 --> 00:08:06,410
Have you ever tried to juggle?

196
00:08:06,410 --> 00:08:08,160
Yes, I'm juggling my love for you

197
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:11,560
and my embarrassment of you right now.

198
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:15,250
And it's hard, isn't it?

199
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:18,060
So the key is,

200
00:08:18,060 --> 00:08:20,850
the moment one ball is at the top of its arc,

201
00:08:20,850 --> 00:08:22,970
you toss the next one.

202
00:08:22,970 --> 00:08:24,560
Okay, I think I got that.

203
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:25,860
Uh, h-hold on.

204
00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:28,590
There's a, an old saying in juggling.

205
00:08:28,590 --> 00:08:31,560
Is it "I'm going to die alone"?

206
00:08:34,060 --> 00:08:38,520
No, it's "If you want to have fun, start with one."

207
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:41,180
Yours we think, but we do not say.

208
00:08:41,180 --> 00:08:43,790
All right, just toss it up and catch it a few times,

209
00:08:43,790 --> 00:08:45,020
get comfortable with it.

210
00:08:45,020 --> 00:08:46,650
Okay.

211
00:08:52,210 --> 00:08:53,260
Just to be on the safe side,

212
00:08:53,260 --> 00:08:56,700
am I in any danger of getting juggler's elbow?

213
00:08:56,700 --> 00:08:58,380
No.

214
00:08:59,340 --> 00:09:02,390
Are you sure? 'Cause I'm feeling a twinge.

215
00:09:04,370 --> 00:09:05,890
See, that wasn't so bad.

216
00:09:05,890 --> 00:09:07,180
He even picked up the check.

217
00:09:07,180 --> 00:09:08,010
Yeah.

218
00:09:08,010 --> 00:09:09,580
Although, when he was trying to figure out the tip,

219
00:09:09,580 --> 00:09:14,250
I'm pretty sure I saw smoke coming out of his ears.

220
00:09:14,250 --> 00:09:16,840
You're not really considering working for him, are you?

221
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:19,410
Well, maybe, I mean, it seems kind of perfect.

222
00:09:19,410 --> 00:09:21,040
I have sales experience,

223
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:23,340
and I've been a waitress, so I have restaurant experience,

224
00:09:23,340 --> 00:09:25,630
and if he's figuring out my Christmas bonus,

225
00:09:25,630 --> 00:09:28,240
we could buy a boat.

226
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:30,420
Don't you think it might be a little weird

227
00:09:30,420 --> 00:09:32,400
to work for someone you used to date?

228
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:35,880
You work with Sheldon, you tell me.

229
00:09:37,350 --> 00:09:39,880
Yeah, it's weird.

230
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:45,850
Okay, are you seriously jealous of me working with Zack?

231
00:09:45,850 --> 00:09:47,880
No, no, I-I'm not jealous, I just think

232
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:50,200
you have got a good thing going where you are right now,

233
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:51,290
and you make great money

234
00:09:51,290 --> 00:09:54,150
and you haven't slept with any of your coworkers.

235
00:09:54,150 --> 00:09:57,410
Great, so you want me to stay at a job I'm not happy at?

236
00:09:59,930 --> 00:10:01,020
You okay?

237
00:10:01,020 --> 00:10:04,890
You kind of look like Zack trying to figure out that tip.

238
00:10:04,890 --> 00:10:08,160
Of course I don't want you to be unhappy,

239
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:09,870
but I also want you to be smart,

240
00:10:09,870 --> 00:10:13,550
and working for an ex-boyfriend isn't very smart.

241
00:10:14,890 --> 00:10:17,840
You don't have to stop, just slow down, I'll jump out.

242
00:10:22,330 --> 00:10:25,350
Amy, look, I'm on a unicycle!

243
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:30,300
How did you get from croissants to a unicycle?

244
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:32,580
I hurt myself juggling.

245
00:10:33,470 --> 00:10:34,630
Where did you get it?

246
00:10:34,630 --> 00:10:36,310
Howard said I could borrow it,

247
00:10:36,310 --> 00:10:39,200
Bernadette said forever.

248
00:10:39,820 --> 00:10:41,520
Have you tried letting go of the rope?

249
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:44,900
What, are you crazy? I'm on a unicycle.

250
00:10:45,390 --> 00:10:47,050
All right, well, have fun.

251
00:10:47,050 --> 00:10:48,990
Wait, I need help getting down.

252
00:10:48,990 --> 00:10:50,350
Well, what do you want me to do?

253
00:10:50,350 --> 00:10:52,290
Drag out our mattress and put it over here,

254
00:10:52,290 --> 00:10:53,990
then go across the hall, get their mattress

255
00:10:53,990 --> 00:10:55,090
and put it over here.

256
00:10:55,090 --> 00:10:56,120
But before you do any of that,

257
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:58,280
scratch my nose.

258
00:11:01,900 --> 00:11:04,830
So you told her she was being dumb?

259
00:11:04,830 --> 00:11:08,950
No, I told her she was being not smart.

260
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:12,230
Which was dumb.

261
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:14,680
Why did you even go to dinner with the guy?

262
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:17,540
We covered this, I'm dumb.

263
00:11:19,030 --> 00:11:21,090
So he's my ex-boyfriend, who cares?

264
00:11:21,090 --> 00:11:23,020
I can't believe Leonard would be so insecure.

265
00:11:23,020 --> 00:11:24,000
Really?

266
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,580
I have no trouble believing that at all.

267
00:11:27,580 --> 00:11:28,750
And Zack's engaged.

268
00:11:28,750 --> 00:11:31,020
Leonard has no reason to feel threatened.

269
00:11:31,020 --> 00:11:34,380
We're talking about the same Leonard, right?

270
00:11:34,980 --> 00:11:37,780
So you think it's fine if she works for Zack?

271
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:39,060
I don't know, maybe.

272
00:11:39,060 --> 00:11:42,860
Well, he is much more attractive than Leonard.

273
00:11:43,270 --> 00:11:44,070
Yes,

274
00:11:44,070 --> 00:11:48,840
but that's gonna be true of a lot of guys she works for.

275
00:11:49,530 --> 00:11:52,590
Yeah, but she also used to sleep with Zack.

276
00:11:52,590 --> 00:11:55,010
Again...

277
00:11:56,820 --> 00:11:58,890
I would never let Howard work with an ex.

278
00:11:58,890 --> 00:11:59,940
What, you wouldn't trust him?

279
00:11:59,940 --> 00:12:01,670
I wouldn't trust her.

280
00:12:01,670 --> 00:12:06,340
He's thin and sexy like a Jewish greyhound.

281
00:12:07,390 --> 00:12:11,550
Yeah, that-that is the sexiest dog.

282
00:12:11,550 --> 00:12:13,100
And I'd like to think Howie wouldn't take a job

283
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:14,620
I was uncomfortable with.

284
00:12:14,620 --> 00:12:15,790
- 'Cause he's scared of you? - Terrified.

285
00:12:15,790 --> 00:12:17,700
Yeah.

286
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:20,420
You know what? I'm with Leonard, this isn't cool.

287
00:12:20,420 --> 00:12:21,270
Thank you.

288
00:12:21,270 --> 00:12:22,790
I disagree.

289
00:12:22,790 --> 00:12:25,110
Penny is a strong, independent woman.

290
00:12:25,110 --> 00:12:27,660
The more you try to control her, the more she'll push back.

291
00:12:27,660 --> 00:12:29,030
So you think it's okay?

292
00:12:29,030 --> 00:12:30,610
Oh, no, she's gonna leave you for someone,

293
00:12:30,610 --> 00:12:33,420
might as well get it over with.

294
00:12:37,740 --> 00:12:39,390
What are you doing?

295
00:12:39,390 --> 00:12:41,600
I'm returning this stuff to Howard.

296
00:12:42,740 --> 00:12:44,530
Well, Bernadette made me promise if you didn't want it,

297
00:12:44,530 --> 00:12:47,430
we'd give it to a homeless clown.

298
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:51,270
What happened to learning the unicycle?

299
00:12:51,270 --> 00:12:53,210
Oh, I stopped that, it was dumb.

300
00:12:53,210 --> 00:12:55,420
Uni, bi, tri, menstrual,

301
00:12:55,420 --> 00:12:57,980
all cycles are dumb.

302
00:12:59,070 --> 00:13:00,600
You said juggling was dumb, too.

303
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:01,600
Well, it is.

304
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:02,870
If I wanted to hold three things at once,

305
00:13:02,870 --> 00:13:05,290
I'd wear cargo pants.

306
00:13:05,890 --> 00:13:07,230
Sheldon, is it possible that

307
00:13:07,230 --> 00:13:09,430
when things get really difficult,

308
00:13:09,430 --> 00:13:11,940
you just give up?

309
00:13:11,940 --> 00:13:14,210
Are you calling me a quitter?

310
00:13:14,210 --> 00:13:15,340
Well, if you honestly...

311
00:13:15,340 --> 00:13:17,620
This conversation is over.

312
00:13:21,590 --> 00:13:23,300
His mother warned me.

313
00:13:24,260 --> 00:13:26,800
Everybody warned me.

314
00:13:27,330 --> 00:13:30,310
Actually, he warned me.

315
00:13:36,190 --> 00:13:37,620
You want to talk?

316
00:13:37,620 --> 00:13:40,910
That doesn't seem to be where I shine.

317
00:13:42,150 --> 00:13:44,460
How about I just give you one of these?

318
00:13:45,590 --> 00:13:47,490
Look, we can have a reasonable conversation

319
00:13:47,490 --> 00:13:49,420
and I won't get mad.

320
00:13:51,790 --> 00:13:55,430
I don't like it after sex, and I don't like it now.

321
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:01,760
- Yeah, sorry. - Yeah.

322
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:03,900
All right, just come here.

323
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:06,450
Look, I get me working with Zack is weird

324
00:14:06,450 --> 00:14:07,950
and I don't want you to be uncomfortable.

325
00:14:07,950 --> 00:14:08,980
Well, thanks.

326
00:14:08,980 --> 00:14:12,060
And I don't want you to be stuck at a job you don't like.

327
00:14:12,060 --> 00:14:13,510
Then what do we do?

328
00:14:13,510 --> 00:14:15,420
Well, I don't love it, but if you really want to take this job,

329
00:14:15,420 --> 00:14:17,140
I'll find a way to deal with it.

330
00:14:17,140 --> 00:14:19,530
No, I know you'll try, but it'll make you miserable,

331
00:14:19,530 --> 00:14:21,360
which will make me miserable, and...

332
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:23,140
I'm just gonna stay where I'm at for now.

333
00:14:23,140 --> 00:14:25,100
No, no, no, no, you're-you're unhappy there

334
00:14:25,100 --> 00:14:26,970
and then you're gonna blame me for making you stay,

335
00:14:26,970 --> 00:14:28,920
and it's fine, I'll just-- I'll suck it up.

336
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:30,880
You don't need to do that, it's okay.

337
00:14:31,470 --> 00:14:33,070
Yeah, see, now I feel terrible,

338
00:14:33,070 --> 00:14:36,950
like I'm being selfish and holding you back.

339
00:14:40,090 --> 00:14:42,050
What? Say something.

340
00:14:46,050 --> 00:14:48,160
Yeah, that is pretty annoying.

341
00:14:51,620 --> 00:14:52,680
I made you tea.

342
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:54,700
Thank you.

343
00:14:54,700 --> 00:14:56,280
I'm sorry I called you a quitter.

344
00:14:56,280 --> 00:14:59,510
It's okay, I stopped being upset about that.

345
00:14:59,510 --> 00:15:02,870
And no, the irony is not lost on me.

346
00:15:03,330 --> 00:15:04,650
What are you reading?

347
00:15:04,650 --> 00:15:06,870
This article says the peak age for making

348
00:15:06,870 --> 00:15:09,400
a Nobel Prize-winning discovery is 40.

349
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:10,460
So?

350
00:15:10,460 --> 00:15:12,240
So I'm running out of time.

351
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:15,630
That's ridiculous, you're a brilliant man.

352
00:15:15,630 --> 00:15:18,010
The best years of your life are still ahead of you.

353
00:15:18,010 --> 00:15:21,350
Oh, you have to say that, you're sweet on me.

354
00:15:21,350 --> 00:15:23,060
Well, if you're really worried about your career,

355
00:15:23,060 --> 00:15:25,020
maybe you should consider spending a little less time

356
00:15:25,020 --> 00:15:27,690
with video games and comic books.

357
00:15:29,070 --> 00:15:31,230
I thought you were sweet on me.

358
00:15:31,650 --> 00:15:34,550
Okay, fine, let's say you never win a Nobel Prize.

359
00:15:34,550 --> 00:15:37,650
Let's say you spend your life doing solid scientific research

360
00:15:37,650 --> 00:15:39,270
surrounded by friends and loved ones

361
00:15:39,270 --> 00:15:40,750
who appreciate you,

362
00:15:40,750 --> 00:15:42,140
not for what you've accomplished

363
00:15:42,140 --> 00:15:44,250
but for who you are as a man.

364
00:15:44,250 --> 00:15:47,800
Wouldn't that be a life well-lived?

365
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:50,190
You're so cute.

366
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:53,410
I'm gonna go learn how to walk on stilts.

367
00:15:56,100 --> 00:15:59,020
So many warnings.

368
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:02,760
Okay, are you sure about this?

369
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:05,240
Absolutely. I just want you to be happy.

370
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:09,070
And maybe a little turned on about how selfless I'm being.

371
00:16:11,110 --> 00:16:12,640
Penny, what's up?

372
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:15,070
Hey, uh, so I've been thinking about it

373
00:16:15,070 --> 00:16:16,890
and I want to take the job.

374
00:16:16,890 --> 00:16:19,110
Oh, bad news.

375
00:16:19,110 --> 00:16:21,190
When my fiance found out that I was offering a job

376
00:16:21,190 --> 00:16:23,730
to my ex-girlfriend, she said it was a stupid idea

377
00:16:23,730 --> 00:16:26,740
and threw a shoe at me.

378
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:29,320
Oh, so there's no job?

379
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:33,380
Nope, just a little bump on my forehead.

380
00:16:33,750 --> 00:16:35,210
Okay, thanks anyway.

381
00:16:35,210 --> 00:16:37,070
Bye.

382
00:16:37,450 --> 00:16:38,440
Well, his fiance thought

383
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:41,460
the idea of us working together was stupid.

384
00:16:41,460 --> 00:16:44,390
You were right, I was wrong.

385
00:16:48,740 --> 00:16:50,740
Aren't you gonna say anything?

386
00:16:50,740 --> 00:16:53,080
Not if I want to be doing this later.

387
00:16:58,250 --> 00:16:59,750
Hey, I didn't know you were home.

388
00:16:59,750 --> 00:17:00,950
Where you been?

389
00:17:00,950 --> 00:17:03,000
I went to see your mom.

390
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,250
Seriously, where were you?

391
00:17:05,250 --> 00:17:06,980
I just told you, your mom's.

392
00:17:06,980 --> 00:17:08,100
Why?

393
00:17:08,100 --> 00:17:11,990
Well, since you find my magic tricks so embarrassing,

394
00:17:11,990 --> 00:17:13,720
I got to wondering

395
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:17,240
what cool hobbies you had as a kid.

396
00:17:18,740 --> 00:17:21,220
What'd she say?

397
00:17:21,220 --> 00:17:22,980
She didn't say much of anything.

398
00:17:22,980 --> 00:17:26,270
But she said a lot!

399
00:17:28,060 --> 00:17:31,450
Hi, Bernadette, remember me?

400
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:35,050
First of all, that's not what she sounds like,

401
00:17:35,050 --> 00:17:38,100
she's from South Carolina.

402
00:17:38,870 --> 00:17:41,090
I can't believe you made fun of me all these years

403
00:17:41,090 --> 00:17:45,230
while you were a closeted ventriloquist.

404
00:17:45,230 --> 00:17:48,690
Okay, it's not like I wanted to be a ventriloquist.

405
00:17:48,690 --> 00:17:50,910
I was in beauty pageants and I needed a talent

406
00:17:50,910 --> 00:17:52,090
besides spreading rumors

407
00:17:52,090 --> 00:17:55,120
that the other contestants were pregnant.

408
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:57,000
Well, since you enjoyed

409
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,490
getting rid of all my stuff, you know,

410
00:17:58,490 --> 00:18:01,060
maybe we should throw this little lady in the wood chipper.

411
00:18:01,060 --> 00:18:02,560
No!

412
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:04,710
And the little lady has a name.

413
00:18:05,180 --> 00:18:06,940
Which is?

414
00:18:07,930 --> 00:18:11,450
Tammy Jo St. Cloud.

415
00:18:12,150 --> 00:18:14,660
"Tammy Jo St. Cloud."

416
00:18:14,660 --> 00:18:16,910
Oh, and I'm a dork for juggling.

417
00:18:16,910 --> 00:18:19,640
Sorry, you're not a dork.

418
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:22,460
You're a clown.

419
00:18:23,250 --> 00:18:24,560
Tammy Jo, don't say that,

420
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:26,520
you'll make him feel bad.

421
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:27,490
Look at him,

422
00:18:27,490 --> 00:18:31,660
what reason he got to feel good?

423
00:18:31,660 --> 00:18:33,500
All right, very funny.

424
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:34,320
Don't listen to her,

425
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:36,930
she's been in a box for, like, 25 years.

426
00:18:36,930 --> 00:18:40,020
Yeah, back when his haircut was fashionable.

427
00:18:42,910 --> 00:18:44,460
That's enough, put her away.

428
00:18:44,460 --> 00:18:45,610
Oh, big daddy,

429
00:18:45,610 --> 00:18:47,000
I don't think so.

430
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:51,010
You marry Miss Bernie, you marry me.

431
00:18:51,010 --> 00:18:54,740
We all family now.

432
00:18:55,580 --> 00:18:57,160
All right, you're freaking me out.

433
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:58,450
Don't be that way.

434
00:18:58,450 --> 00:18:59,830
If you don't mind a few splinters,

435
00:18:59,830 --> 00:19:02,310
we can have us a menage a trois.

436
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,810
I'm doing it.

437
00:19:10,810 --> 00:19:12,440
I'm doing it.

438
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:17,430
I'm tall and I'm doing it!

439
00:19:20,210 --> 00:19:23,240
Ah, man.
