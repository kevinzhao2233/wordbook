1
00:00:01,130 --> 00:00:03,020
Previously on The Big Bang Theory...

2
00:00:03,750 --> 00:00:07,880
I was offered a summer research fellowship at Princeton.

3
00:00:09,050 --> 00:00:11,030
Princeton.

4
00:00:11,030 --> 00:00:13,800
A fine institution.

5
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:16,430
The place where Albert Einstein taught,

6
00:00:16,430 --> 00:00:18,550
and where Leonard got his PhD,

7
00:00:18,550 --> 00:00:21,400
so it may have gone downhill.

8
00:00:22,700 --> 00:00:24,740
And just remember, I'm proud of you.

9
00:00:24,740 --> 00:00:27,190
And I support you in all that you do.

10
00:00:27,820 --> 00:00:29,330
Thank you. That means a lot.

11
00:00:29,330 --> 00:00:30,480
Oh, and one last thing.

12
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:33,350
If you find yourself working with a male scientist,

13
00:00:33,350 --> 00:00:35,990
who's as smart as me, as tall as me,

14
00:00:35,990 --> 00:00:37,660
and has hair like Thor,

15
00:00:37,660 --> 00:00:39,890
well, then, I want you to step away from the situation

16
00:00:39,890 --> 00:00:42,520
and call me immediately.

17
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:46,460
How are you settling in?

18
00:00:46,460 --> 00:00:47,640
Pretty well.

19
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:49,800
Princeton has a beautiful campus.

20
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:51,870
Now, I've learned some fun facts about New Jersey

21
00:00:51,870 --> 00:00:53,520
to help you make small talk.

22
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:58,280
Would you like to know the state bird or the murder rate?

23
00:00:58,770 --> 00:01:01,500
They're both shocking.

24
00:01:01,910 --> 00:01:03,720
Actually, I want to hear about you.

25
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:05,120
How are things at home?

26
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:08,180
Well, I'm a lot less likely to see an Eastern Goldfinch

27
00:01:08,180 --> 00:01:11,300
or be murdered, I'll tell you that.

28
00:01:11,620 --> 00:01:12,840
I miss you.

29
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:14,400
I miss you, too.

30
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:15,290
It's so strange,

31
00:01:15,290 --> 00:01:17,800
earlier today I ended a sentence with a preposition

32
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:20,800
and you weren't there to correct my grammar.

33
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:24,070
I'm sorry you had to go through that.

34
00:01:24,930 --> 00:01:26,190
In fact,

35
00:01:26,190 --> 00:01:29,520
that's when I started to really miss you.

36
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:33,890
You know you just split an infinitive.

37
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:36,030
Did I?

38
00:01:36,030 --> 00:01:38,960
Are you gonna teach me a lesson?

39
00:01:40,770 --> 00:01:42,940
I am.

40
00:01:42,940 --> 00:01:45,200
It is naughty to put an adverb

41
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:48,860
between the word "to" and the verb stem.

42
00:01:48,860 --> 00:01:51,320
What are you gonna do about it?

43
00:01:51,730 --> 00:01:54,680
I'm going to admonish you.

44
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:57,890
Vigorously?

45
00:01:57,890 --> 00:02:01,430
That's the only kind of admonishing I do.

46
00:02:27,410 --> 00:02:29,210
How's Sheldon doing with Amy gone?

47
00:02:29,210 --> 00:02:30,430
Well, the last three nights

48
00:02:30,430 --> 00:02:32,270
I've had to take him to get a haircut,

49
00:02:32,270 --> 00:02:35,050
to the train store, and to a Walgreens in Arcadia

50
00:02:35,050 --> 00:02:38,760
where they still have the "Good ibuprofen."

51
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:41,620
Now ask me how I'm doing with Amy gone.

52
00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:43,810
- How are you doing with... - Shut up.

53
00:02:44,990 --> 00:02:47,400
If you'd like, we can help you out.

54
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:48,730
Oh, that would be great.

55
00:02:48,730 --> 00:02:50,300
I mean, not me, I've got a wife and child,

56
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:54,420
but this one posts video of himself flossing on Instagram.

57
00:02:55,190 --> 00:02:57,930
It was a tutorial.

58
00:02:58,670 --> 00:03:01,030
And yes, I'm happy to keep Sheldon company.

59
00:03:01,030 --> 00:03:03,760
Great. Tonight he wants to look at ladders at Home Depot.

60
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:04,840
Oh, why does he need a ladder?

61
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:06,290
He doesn't; he just likes looking at them.

62
00:03:06,290 --> 00:03:08,730
Bring a book.

63
00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:09,670
Gentlemen.

64
00:03:09,670 --> 00:03:11,300
You may remember Dr. Nowitzki,

65
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:13,650
She's back at Caltech for her postdoc.

66
00:03:13,650 --> 00:03:15,150
- Hello. - Hello.

67
00:03:15,150 --> 00:03:16,280
Oh, let me bring a chair for you.

68
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:17,340
Oh, thanks.

69
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:18,630
Dr. Nowitzki's going to tell me

70
00:03:18,630 --> 00:03:20,380
about the work she did at CERN.

71
00:03:20,380 --> 00:03:24,320
And she brought me this duty-free Toblerone.

72
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:26,180
Oh. I love those.

73
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:28,550
Let's sit somewhere else.

74
00:03:32,510 --> 00:03:34,900
What just happened?

75
00:03:35,870 --> 00:03:40,290
A stranger just lured Sheldon away with a candy bar.

76
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:43,980
Wait, isn't she the grad student that used to follow him around?

77
00:03:43,980 --> 00:03:45,220
Oh, yeah.

78
00:03:45,220 --> 00:03:49,060
Back before he hit puberty and grew man parts.

79
00:03:49,660 --> 00:03:51,630
So what do you guys think that's about?

80
00:03:51,630 --> 00:03:53,200
Knowing Sheldon, nothing.

81
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:56,440
So, tell me about your scalar dark energy experiment.

82
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:57,930
Not 'til you tell me about your latest paper

83
00:03:57,930 --> 00:03:59,630
on quantum loop theory.

84
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:03,440
You must be one of those dessert before dinner people.

85
00:04:05,410 --> 00:04:07,800
He just made her laugh, something's wrong.

86
00:04:08,890 --> 00:04:11,480
Do you see the way she's looking at him?

87
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:14,390
Yeah. Like Bernadette used to look at me.

88
00:04:14,390 --> 00:04:18,100
I keep telling you, close the bathroom door.

89
00:04:19,940 --> 00:04:21,260
Ah, did you see that?

90
00:04:21,260 --> 00:04:23,440
She just touched his hand and he didn't swat it away.

91
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:25,570
What is happening?

92
00:04:25,570 --> 00:04:29,620
Okay, the simplest explanation is usually the right one.

93
00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:30,990
Which is?

94
00:04:30,990 --> 00:04:33,560
That ain't Sheldon.

95
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:37,890
Not only did they eat together,

96
00:04:37,890 --> 00:04:40,000
Leonard said he made her laugh.

97
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:40,920
That's nothing,

98
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:43,470
Howie said she touched his hand.

99
00:04:43,470 --> 00:04:45,240
Did he Purell?

100
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:47,510
No.

101
00:04:48,330 --> 00:04:50,180
I cannot believe Leonard mentioned the Toblerone

102
00:04:50,180 --> 00:04:52,500
but left that part out.

103
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:54,400
Should we call Amy?

104
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:57,380
I don't know; we shouldn't worry her if it's nothing.

105
00:04:57,380 --> 00:04:58,240
I guess we could wait

106
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:01,280
- till we have more information about this girl. - Yeah.

107
00:05:01,780 --> 00:05:03,060
Do you think living with Amy

108
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:05,640
has somehow stirred up Sheldon's...

109
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:08,550
sexual appetite?

110
00:05:14,550 --> 00:05:17,640
How can you think that?

111
00:05:17,990 --> 00:05:21,360
Why would you even put those words together?

112
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:22,250
All right, then we agree.

113
00:05:22,250 --> 00:05:23,350
He's not making any moves,

114
00:05:23,350 --> 00:05:25,740
it's this Dr. Ramona chick.

115
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:28,640
Nowitzki. I Googled her, she's pretty cute.

116
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:30,230
Really? All I got from Leonard

117
00:05:30,230 --> 00:05:34,150
was the Toblerone bar had nuts.

118
00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:36,710
And get this,

119
00:05:36,710 --> 00:05:38,910
I saw an articulating ladder

120
00:05:38,910 --> 00:05:41,810
with dual-leg leveling, which delivers stability

121
00:05:41,810 --> 00:05:45,160
and adaptability to uneven terrain.

122
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:47,520
Sounds like a big night.

123
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:50,080
Yeah. Raj made the funniest joke, he said,

124
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:54,170
"Which is the best ladder to use to hang myself?"

125
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:59,480
So you're keeping busy? You're not lonely?

126
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:00,500
Oh, not at all.

127
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:03,320
I've had outings with Leonard and Raj in the evening,

128
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:05,980
and-- oh, I had lunch with Dr. Nowitzki.

129
00:06:05,980 --> 00:06:06,880
Who's he?

130
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:08,940
Oh, Dr. Nowitzki is a woman.

131
00:06:08,940 --> 00:06:09,880
Oh. Really?

132
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:11,260
Uh, when did you meet her?

133
00:06:11,260 --> 00:06:12,250
Many years ago.

134
00:06:12,250 --> 00:06:13,960
Back when she was a grad student.

135
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:15,850
She's always been a huge fan of my work,

136
00:06:15,850 --> 00:06:19,480
and now she's doing research at Caltech.

137
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:22,170
Huge fan, you say?

138
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:24,260
Yes. I think you'd like her.

139
00:06:24,260 --> 00:06:27,270
She's extremely intelligent, just like you.

140
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:29,500
Unlike you, she's tall, blonde

141
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:32,970
and used to be an Olympic swimmer.

142
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:37,970
That's terrific. I'll call you right back.

143
00:06:39,740 --> 00:06:40,540
Oh, hey, Amy.

144
00:06:40,540 --> 00:06:44,450
I gave you one job!

145
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:46,200
Keep an eye on him.

146
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:48,770
How hard is that?

147
00:06:48,770 --> 00:06:49,870
We thought you meant

148
00:06:49,870 --> 00:06:53,580
not letting him run out into traffic.

149
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:57,220
- Which he only did once. - Yeah.

150
00:06:57,900 --> 00:06:59,840
Why didn't you tell me?

151
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:01,580
We didn't want you to worry.

152
00:07:01,580 --> 00:07:02,980
Should I worry?

153
00:07:02,980 --> 00:07:04,310
No. Come on, it's Sheldon.

154
00:07:04,310 --> 00:07:05,920
Nothing is gonna happen.

155
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:08,020
That's what you said to me when I started dating him.

156
00:07:08,020 --> 00:07:09,270
And then five years later,

157
00:07:09,270 --> 00:07:12,260
bingo-bango, something happened.

158
00:07:12,260 --> 00:07:14,700
Yeah, but you're gonna be back in three months.

159
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:16,000
You don't get it.

160
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,680
I've been smacking that ketchup bottle for a long time.

161
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:20,180
All she's got to do is tip it over

162
00:07:20,180 --> 00:07:23,330
and point it at her fries.

163
00:07:23,330 --> 00:07:24,980
Well, what do you want us to do?

164
00:07:24,980 --> 00:07:26,640
I don't know.

165
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:27,870
Might be the New Jersey talking,

166
00:07:27,870 --> 00:07:32,690
but this Nowitzki broad needs to disappear.

167
00:07:32,980 --> 00:07:34,190
That's ridiculous.

168
00:07:34,190 --> 00:07:35,240
As far as we know,

169
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:38,260
all that happened is two scientists had lunch.

170
00:07:38,260 --> 00:07:39,800
Yeah, but one of those scientists

171
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:42,040
is a tall, blonde Olympic swimmer.

172
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:45,670
Come on. Looks don't matter to Sheldon.

173
00:07:45,670 --> 00:07:50,110
Because he only has eyes for you.

174
00:07:50,490 --> 00:07:51,410
Nice try.

175
00:07:51,410 --> 00:07:54,520
Thanks. I was scrambling.

176
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:58,160
It's unbelievable.

177
00:07:58,160 --> 00:07:59,910
Sheldon has lunch with another woman

178
00:07:59,910 --> 00:08:02,690
and somehow my wife yells at me.

179
00:08:02,690 --> 00:08:04,380
Penny laid into me, too.

180
00:08:04,380 --> 00:08:06,240
Apparently, I'm overly fixated on

181
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:09,650
premium Swiss chocolate bars.

182
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:11,660
Can you even eat those things?

183
00:08:11,660 --> 00:08:13,670
If I take a Lactaid a half-hour before

184
00:08:13,670 --> 00:08:16,000
and some Pepto right after.

185
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,600
Sounds like a lot of work.

186
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:20,130
Yeah. Eh, I'm worth it.

187
00:08:20,830 --> 00:08:22,190
Guys. Focus.

188
00:08:22,190 --> 00:08:24,190
Should we do something about Nowitzki?

189
00:08:24,190 --> 00:08:25,560
Like what?

190
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:27,880
Uh, well, she's single,

191
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:30,890
so if somebody else asks her out and she says yes,

192
00:08:30,890 --> 00:08:32,660
then we know she's not into Sheldon.

193
00:08:32,660 --> 00:08:34,640
I'll do it.

194
00:08:39,660 --> 00:08:41,050
No offense, Stuart,

195
00:08:41,050 --> 00:08:43,290
but th-th-the woman's a doctor.

196
00:08:43,290 --> 00:08:45,680
So? Doctors like me.

197
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:47,100
Whenever I see mine he calls in

198
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:49,990
a bunch of other doctors to have a look.

199
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:55,380
She's not that kind of doctor.

200
00:08:55,910 --> 00:08:57,220
Well, her loss.

201
00:08:57,220 --> 00:09:01,640
I've been called a genuine medical oddity.

202
00:09:06,190 --> 00:09:08,520
Actually, I was going to suggest me.

203
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:11,830
Great. Anybody's better than, mmm.

204
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:14,170
Excuse me.

205
00:09:14,170 --> 00:09:16,210
They took out my spleen and gallbladder,

206
00:09:16,210 --> 00:09:18,650
not my feelings.

207
00:09:25,930 --> 00:09:27,230
Dr. Nowitzki.

208
00:09:27,230 --> 00:09:29,660
- Good to see you. - Good to see you, too.

209
00:09:29,660 --> 00:09:30,780
May I join you?

210
00:09:30,780 --> 00:09:32,730
No.

211
00:09:35,550 --> 00:09:37,890
Good to see you.

212
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:43,100
We should call Guinness, that might be a record.

213
00:09:43,430 --> 00:09:45,670
She's clearly having a working lunch

214
00:09:45,670 --> 00:09:48,120
and preferred to eat alone.

215
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:51,120
Dr. Cooper, over here.

216
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:55,330
I could have made her very happy.

217
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:59,540
You kept walking. I think you did.

218
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:03,170
Do you really think there's reason to worry?

219
00:10:03,170 --> 00:10:05,560
Yeah, she's definitely going after Sheldon.

220
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:07,900
I made a play for her and she shot me down.

221
00:10:07,900 --> 00:10:09,480
All right, well, that doesn't prove anything.

222
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:13,930
Yeah, there's a million reasons a woman would shoot Raj down.

223
00:10:15,420 --> 00:10:17,220
Like, really, a million?

224
00:10:17,220 --> 00:10:18,270
Fine, hundreds.

225
00:10:18,270 --> 00:10:20,390
Thank you.

226
00:10:20,390 --> 00:10:21,920
The point is this could be nothing

227
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:24,550
and we are all overreacting.

228
00:10:24,950 --> 00:10:26,120
Hey, everybody.

229
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:27,180
This is my friend,

230
00:10:27,180 --> 00:10:29,290
- Dr. Nowitzki. - Hi.

231
00:10:29,290 --> 00:10:32,110
Hi.

232
00:10:32,490 --> 00:10:35,260
We just went swimming.

233
00:10:40,130 --> 00:10:42,190
And you actually got in a pool?

234
00:10:42,190 --> 00:10:43,430
I was scared,

235
00:10:43,430 --> 00:10:48,060
but I told myself it's just a big bathtub.

236
00:10:48,060 --> 00:10:49,360
Then I got scared again 'cause there are

237
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:52,190
all these strangers in my bathtub.

238
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:54,100
I was proud of him-- a lot of people

239
00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:56,420
don't put their face in the water on the first day.

240
00:10:56,420 --> 00:10:59,660
Well, I was hiding from a bee, but it still counts.

241
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:04,690
Can I just squeeze in here?

242
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:09,520
So, Sheldon, have you talked to Amy?

243
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:11,090
Yes, we Skyped this morning

244
00:11:11,090 --> 00:11:13,340
and I'm sure I'll check in with her before I go to sleep.

245
00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:14,920
Sheldon talks about her all the time.

246
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:16,030
I can't wait to meet her.

247
00:11:16,030 --> 00:11:17,200
That is true.

248
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:20,940
She keeps asking how long Amy's going to be gone.

249
00:11:22,430 --> 00:11:24,680
Uh, so, Ramona, tell us about yourself.

250
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:26,150
Do you, do you have a boyfriend?

251
00:11:26,340 --> 00:11:28,680
Leonard, your wife is sitting right here.

252
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:31,040
What are you doing?

253
00:11:32,940 --> 00:11:35,620
No, my work doesn't leave me a lot of time for relationships.

254
00:11:35,620 --> 00:11:38,730
I think you made that very clear.

255
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:41,890
She was part of the American team at CERN.

256
00:11:41,890 --> 00:11:44,680
I had a front row seat when they detected the Higgs boson.

257
00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:46,180
Do you know,

258
00:11:46,180 --> 00:11:48,120
I've corresponded with Peter Higgs.

259
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:49,570
Would you like to see some of his letters?

260
00:11:49,570 --> 00:11:51,520
- Absolutely. - I'll get them.

261
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:53,820
Well, hang on, I'll come with you.

262
00:11:53,820 --> 00:11:54,980
Oh, fun.

263
00:11:54,980 --> 00:11:57,380
Like a play date.

264
00:11:59,350 --> 00:12:01,240
Okay, correct me if I'm wrong, but isn't that exactly

265
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:04,200
what we were supposed to stop from happening?

266
00:12:05,070 --> 00:12:06,180
I threw my body at them,

267
00:12:06,180 --> 00:12:08,770
what else did you want me to do?

268
00:12:10,630 --> 00:12:12,150
You think you should call Amy?

269
00:12:12,150 --> 00:12:15,130
You got fingers and a mouth, you call her.

270
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:19,160
Here you go.

271
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:20,920
Are these all from Peter Higgs?

272
00:12:21,210 --> 00:12:21,910
Oh, no, no, no.

273
00:12:21,910 --> 00:12:23,700
They're from many famous people.

274
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:24,740
See? Oh, like this one.

275
00:12:24,740 --> 00:12:26,340
This is from Patrick Stewart.

276
00:12:26,340 --> 00:12:29,100
It says if I come to his house again,

277
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:31,700
I get to meet his dogs.

278
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:36,900
Oh, excuse me.

279
00:12:39,130 --> 00:12:42,040
- Hello, Sheldon. - Oh, hello, Amy.

280
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:43,830
I was missing you again.

281
00:12:43,830 --> 00:12:45,210
I miss you, too.

282
00:12:45,210 --> 00:12:47,190
Hey, this is good timing.

283
00:12:47,190 --> 00:12:49,930
Remember that Dr. Nowitzki I told you about?

284
00:12:49,930 --> 00:12:52,030
She's right here.

285
00:12:52,380 --> 00:12:55,020
Sh-she's what?

286
00:12:56,540 --> 00:12:58,050
Hello.

287
00:12:58,050 --> 00:12:59,500
Hi.

288
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:01,790
So nice to meet you.

289
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,690
Hang on.

290
00:13:07,690 --> 00:13:09,790
Hello.

291
00:13:09,790 --> 00:13:12,540
A little late, Leonard.

292
00:13:13,310 --> 00:13:14,670
I'm sorry.

293
00:13:14,670 --> 00:13:17,450
What is Leonard doing calling you at this hour?

294
00:13:17,450 --> 00:13:18,910
It's not important.

295
00:13:19,260 --> 00:13:22,880
I must tell you, that seems a little inappropriate.

296
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:23,830
Don't you agree?

297
00:13:23,830 --> 00:13:24,940
I do.

298
00:13:24,940 --> 00:13:26,550
See?

299
00:13:26,550 --> 00:13:29,170
We both think so.

300
00:13:31,260 --> 00:13:32,540
All right, this is making me crazy.

301
00:13:32,540 --> 00:13:34,220
Somebody's got to go over there.

302
00:13:34,220 --> 00:13:37,090
You got feet and legs, you do it.

303
00:13:39,180 --> 00:13:40,570
Will you go with me?

304
00:13:40,570 --> 00:13:44,450
To do what? Shake a can of nickels at them?

305
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,800
We're being ridiculous.

306
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:48,960
There's no way a woman that attractive

307
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:51,800
is trying to seduce Sheldon Cooper.

308
00:13:52,790 --> 00:13:55,940
You done trying to make yourself feel better?

309
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:59,380
No. I haven't played the race card yet.

310
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:03,710
Hey, I hate to break up the party,

311
00:14:03,710 --> 00:14:07,570
but Amy says I'm tired and have to go to bed.

312
00:14:09,270 --> 00:14:10,750
It was nice seeing everybody.

313
00:14:10,750 --> 00:14:12,060
Thank you for dinner.

314
00:14:12,060 --> 00:14:12,960
- Sure. - Our pleasure.

315
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:14,890
Whatever.

316
00:14:16,060 --> 00:14:17,130
Walk me to my car?

317
00:14:17,130 --> 00:14:18,180
Of course.

318
00:14:18,180 --> 00:14:20,230
We'll all go.

319
00:14:36,450 --> 00:14:37,860
Excuse me.

320
00:14:49,170 --> 00:14:51,470
Pardon. I just need to... yeah.

321
00:15:01,850 --> 00:15:03,090
That was fun.

322
00:15:03,090 --> 00:15:05,370
It was like Mario Kart.

323
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:11,000
Bye.

324
00:15:11,410 --> 00:15:12,530
We need to talk.

325
00:15:12,530 --> 00:15:14,170
Wh-- Is this about Leonard and Amy?

326
00:15:14,170 --> 00:15:16,390
I don't like it either.

327
00:15:19,850 --> 00:15:22,130
Okay, I know you don't have a lot of experience with women,

328
00:15:22,130 --> 00:15:23,470
but Ramona seems to have

329
00:15:23,470 --> 00:15:26,050
a romantic interest in you.

330
00:15:26,050 --> 00:15:27,550
That doesn't make any sense.

331
00:15:27,550 --> 00:15:29,210
She knows I have a girlfriend.

332
00:15:29,210 --> 00:15:31,140
Well, sometimes women don't care.

333
00:15:31,140 --> 00:15:34,290
Sometimes it makes them want a guy even more.

334
00:15:34,790 --> 00:15:35,760
That may be true,

335
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:37,890
but Dr. Nowitzki's just a friend.

336
00:15:37,890 --> 00:15:40,450
In fact, I wouldn't have even noticed she's a woman

337
00:15:40,450 --> 00:15:45,110
if she hadn't worn that bathing suit that highlighted her bosom.

338
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:49,180
Okay. Um... ...let's try this.

339
00:15:49,180 --> 00:15:50,990
Think of yourself as one of those

340
00:15:50,990 --> 00:15:54,580
limited edition toys people like to collect.

341
00:15:54,580 --> 00:15:56,960
I already do.

342
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:00,460
Well, then you get it.

343
00:16:01,030 --> 00:16:02,530
Because there's only one of me,

344
00:16:02,530 --> 00:16:03,710
I'm more valuable.

345
00:16:03,710 --> 00:16:05,000
Right.

346
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:08,220
Although, Amy's already taken me out of my package

347
00:16:08,220 --> 00:16:10,810
and played with me.

348
00:16:14,020 --> 00:16:15,700
Let's forget the toy thing, okay?

349
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:18,400
- Um, maybe... - Penny, look. I appreciate your concern,

350
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:21,580
but I don't think that's what's happening.

351
00:16:21,580 --> 00:16:24,450
All right. What do you think is happening?

352
00:16:24,450 --> 00:16:27,740
I think Dr. Nowitzki is a friendly colleague.

353
00:16:27,740 --> 00:16:32,130
I think you and Leonard need to see a marriage counselor.

354
00:16:32,130 --> 00:16:34,550
And I need to update my resume

355
00:16:34,550 --> 00:16:37,730
to include swimming as a special skill.

356
00:16:44,550 --> 00:16:47,730
Don't look at me like that, I tried.

357
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:55,430
Hey, did you eat yet?

358
00:16:55,430 --> 00:16:57,840
Uh, breakfast yes, lunch no.

359
00:16:57,840 --> 00:16:59,140
I did have a cough drop,

360
00:16:59,140 --> 00:17:03,120
but that really rides the line between sucking and eating.

361
00:17:03,830 --> 00:17:05,360
Well, perfect. I made us sandwiches.

362
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:07,460
How thoughtful.

363
00:17:07,460 --> 00:17:08,660
Thank you.

364
00:17:08,660 --> 00:17:09,680
No big deal,

365
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:11,430
I enjoy spending time with you.

366
00:17:11,430 --> 00:17:13,790
And I with you.

367
00:17:14,330 --> 00:17:16,000
Question:

368
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:20,110
are you seeking a romantic relationship with me?

369
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:22,270
What if I were?

370
00:17:22,270 --> 00:17:25,030
Well, that would raise a number of problems.

371
00:17:25,030 --> 00:17:26,350
We're colleagues.

372
00:17:26,350 --> 00:17:28,210
I'm currently in a relation...

373
00:17:36,790 --> 00:17:38,610
Excuse me a moment.

374
00:18:37,820 --> 00:18:38,850
Amy.

375
00:18:39,170 --> 00:18:40,200
Amy.

376
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:41,680
Amy.

377
00:18:58,950 --> 00:19:01,560
Will you marry me?
