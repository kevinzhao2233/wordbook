1
00:00:01,810 --> 00:00:03,200
All right, we're about to go live.

2
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:04,620
Everyone on their A-game!

3
00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:06,660
Good energy!

4
00:00:07,380 --> 00:00:09,500
Hello.

5
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:12,020
I'm Dr. Sheldon Cooper.

6
00:00:12,020 --> 00:00:13,910
And I'm Dr. Amy Farrah Fowler.

7
00:00:13,910 --> 00:00:16,300
And welcome to a special retrospective,

8
00:00:16,300 --> 00:00:19,050
where we will take a look back at the history of Fun with Flags

9
00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:21,270
on an episode we're calling...

10
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:26,680

19
00:00:51,490 --> 00:00:53,950
Mind you, when we say behind the flags

20
00:00:53,950 --> 00:00:56,390
we don't literally mean these flags.

21
00:00:56,390 --> 00:00:59,520
That's just where we have dinner.

22
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:01,940
Now, I'm sure many of you are wondering

23
00:01:01,940 --> 00:01:03,950
how Fun with Flags began.

24
00:01:03,950 --> 00:01:06,170
So let's hear from some people who were there

25
00:01:06,170 --> 00:01:07,620
at the very start.

26
00:01:07,620 --> 00:01:10,300
H-Howard. Flashback sounds.

27
00:01:14,180 --> 00:01:15,140
Could have played that on my harp.

28
00:01:15,140 --> 00:01:17,740
Just roll the clip.

29
00:01:17,740 --> 00:01:20,150
So tell us in your own words

30
00:01:20,150 --> 00:01:23,270
about that magical moment when Fun with Flags was born.

31
00:01:23,270 --> 00:01:25,870
I honestly don't remember.

32
00:01:27,310 --> 00:01:28,650
Sure you do.

33
00:01:28,650 --> 00:01:30,200
I was telling you both the story

34
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:31,770
about how Haiti and Lichtenstein

35
00:01:31,770 --> 00:01:33,630
discovered they had the same flag.

36
00:01:33,630 --> 00:01:36,210
It was at the Summer Olympics of 1936,

37
00:01:36,210 --> 00:01:37,580
and two plucky nations...

38
00:01:37,580 --> 00:01:38,710
Oh, wait. I remember.

39
00:01:38,710 --> 00:01:40,730
Oh, and do you remember what you said?

40
00:01:40,730 --> 00:01:44,500
Yes. Please find someone who cares.

41
00:01:45,230 --> 00:01:48,410
And that's exactly what I did.

42
00:01:49,530 --> 00:01:51,820
I found a lot of someones.

43
00:01:52,210 --> 00:01:54,560
Almost 200.

44
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:58,010
Many of them on purpose.

45
00:01:58,010 --> 00:02:00,910
And now we're going to turn it over to you, the viewers,

46
00:02:00,910 --> 00:02:04,940
to call in and share your favorite Fun with Flags moments.

47
00:02:04,940 --> 00:02:07,550
And-and don't get discouraged if the phone lines are jammed.

48
00:02:07,550 --> 00:02:10,440
Just keep trying.

49
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:31,940
Oh, thank God!

50
00:02:31,940 --> 00:02:34,240
Welcome to Fun with Flags!

51
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:35,110
Hey, Sheldon.

52
00:02:35,110 --> 00:02:36,980
Hey, Amy. It's Bert.

53
00:02:36,980 --> 00:02:38,280
Hello, Bert.

54
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:41,480
What is your flag-related comment or query?

55
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:43,740
I have a girlfriend.

56
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:48,500
And what does that have to do with flags?

57
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:52,210
Nothing. I just wanted everyone to know I have a girlfriend.

58
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:54,340
Bert, you're tying up the line.

59
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:56,160
My apologies to all of you

60
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:59,440
trying to call in with legitimate flag comments.

61
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:02,020
All right. W-We have our next caller.

62
00:03:02,020 --> 00:03:04,270
Her name's Rebecca.

63
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:35,630
Should we get lunch or you want to eat at the zoo?

64
00:03:37,270 --> 00:03:39,090
Oh, Howie, I don't need food

65
00:03:39,090 --> 00:03:42,470
as long as I can look at my phone?

66
00:03:43,550 --> 00:03:45,260
I don't like when you imitate me.

67
00:03:45,260 --> 00:03:46,480
You want to hear my Stuart?

68
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:50,440
It's been a while since I've gone on a date.

69
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:54,820
You mind if we watch the monkeys doing it?

70
00:03:58,930 --> 00:04:02,730
I said that to you in confidence.

71
00:04:03,140 --> 00:04:05,570
This is supposed to be our family fun day.

72
00:04:05,570 --> 00:04:07,400
What's so important on your phone?

73
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:09,130
I'm on the day care's Web site.

74
00:04:09,130 --> 00:04:11,480
Stop looking at that. The day care's great.

75
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:12,630
It's on campus.

76
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:14,290
My office is two minutes away.

77
00:04:14,290 --> 00:04:16,160
There's nothing to worry about.

78
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:18,850
What if she likes the people who work there more than us?

79
00:04:18,850 --> 00:04:22,620
She already likes soap bubbles more than us.

80
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:24,350
When I go back to work,

81
00:04:24,350 --> 00:04:25,650
we're gonna leave her with these people.

82
00:04:25,650 --> 00:04:28,110
We don't know anything about them.

83
00:04:28,110 --> 00:04:31,410
They're highly-trained educators with background checks.

84
00:04:31,410 --> 00:04:35,220
They're even required to be current on all vaccinations.

85
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:39,100
You leave her with me, and I'm not any of those things.

86
00:04:41,610 --> 00:04:42,740
Where's Howard?

87
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:44,440
He took the day off.

88
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:47,180
Oh, let's take advantage of his absence

89
00:04:47,180 --> 00:04:49,640
and tell the kinds of jokes only physicists get.

90
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:51,380
I'll go first.

91
00:04:51,380 --> 00:04:52,350
Okay, here.

92
00:04:52,350 --> 00:04:55,430
Uh, Heisenberg is pulled over by a police officer.

93
00:04:55,430 --> 00:04:56,830
And the policeman says,

94
00:04:56,830 --> 00:04:59,370
Did you know you were going 85 miles per hour?

95
00:04:59,370 --> 00:05:00,690
And Heisenberg says,

96
00:05:00,690 --> 00:05:05,540
Darn it, now I don't know where I am.

98
00:05:05,670 --> 00:05:08,130
- So Howard back Monday? - Yeah.

99
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:10,510
Hey, guys.

100
00:05:10,510 --> 00:05:12,090
- Oh, hello. - Want to join us?

101
00:05:12,090 --> 00:05:15,170
But he's a geologist, and I have more physics jokes.

102
00:05:15,170 --> 00:05:17,160
Oh, quick! Sit!

103
00:05:19,530 --> 00:05:21,740
So, Sheldon says you have a new girlfriend.

104
00:05:21,740 --> 00:05:24,540
Yeah, which he rudely announced on my flag show.

105
00:05:24,540 --> 00:05:25,680
People were so upset about it

106
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:28,820
no one else called in the rest of the night.

107
00:05:28,820 --> 00:05:31,280
Sorry. I couldn't help myself.

108
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:33,730
I guess I just love love.

109
00:05:33,730 --> 00:05:35,640
Well, I'm very happy for you.

110
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:37,080
Hey, we're all having dinner tonight.

111
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:38,400
Why don't the two of you join us?

112
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:39,870
Yeah, wh-- Hold on.

113
00:05:39,870 --> 00:05:42,040
We don't know anything about this woman.

114
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:43,360
What do you want to know?

115
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:44,950
Is she a geologist?

116
00:05:44,950 --> 00:05:47,780
- No. - Oh, great. See you at 7:00.

117
00:05:54,770 --> 00:05:57,670
How about after this we go see the exotic bird show?

118
00:05:57,670 --> 00:05:58,450
Not a good idea.

119
00:05:58,450 --> 00:06:03,300
My hair is a coveted nesting material.

120
00:06:05,070 --> 00:06:06,690
Learning anything?

121
00:06:06,690 --> 00:06:09,690
Well, sloth babies cling to their mothers' bodies

122
00:06:09,690 --> 00:06:11,060
for almost a year.

123
00:06:11,060 --> 00:06:13,090
I'm going back to work after only four months,

124
00:06:13,090 --> 00:06:15,170
so I've learned I hate myself, I hate sloths,

125
00:06:15,170 --> 00:06:18,450
and I hate you for bringing me here.

126
00:06:18,810 --> 00:06:23,280
Me I get, but that sloth is pretty cute.

127
00:06:24,070 --> 00:06:25,800
It's not just the sloth.

128
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:28,720
Polar bears nurse their cubs for almost eight months.

129
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:31,850
The orangutan mother builds her baby a new home every night.

130
00:06:31,850 --> 00:06:32,800
And what do I do?

131
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:35,780
I choose my career over my child!

132
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:41,540
Told you we should have gone to Legoland.

133
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:46,620
Can't believe Bert has a girlfriend and I don't.

134
00:06:46,620 --> 00:06:48,200
I thought you were taking a break from women

135
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:49,720
to focus on your career.

136
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:52,250
Oh, grow up.

137
00:06:55,140 --> 00:06:56,650
Don't you have any friends he can date?

138
00:06:56,650 --> 00:06:58,520
Hey, I already set up Howard and Bernadette.

139
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:01,970
It's your turn to ruin some poor girl's life.

140
00:07:02,580 --> 00:07:04,120
Oh, hey, guys. Come in.

141
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:05,330
Thanks.

142
00:07:05,330 --> 00:07:06,390
Everyone,

143
00:07:06,390 --> 00:07:08,300
this is Rebecca.

144
00:07:09,330 --> 00:07:13,230
She's younger and far more attractive than he is.

145
00:07:14,370 --> 00:07:17,870
They're copying you two.

146
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:22,700
What are you making?

147
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:24,070
Chicken.

148
00:07:24,070 --> 00:07:28,450
Birds mess with my hair, I come back hard.

149
00:07:31,610 --> 00:07:32,980
Finally get Halley down?

150
00:07:32,980 --> 00:07:34,270
Yeah, eventually.

151
00:07:34,270 --> 00:07:36,500
She's still not happy about taking a bottle, though.

152
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:38,450
Look, if you're not ready to go back to work,

153
00:07:38,450 --> 00:07:39,890
we'll figure something out.

154
00:07:39,890 --> 00:07:41,670
No, I'll be fine.

155
00:07:41,670 --> 00:07:43,390
It might be good for her.

156
00:07:43,390 --> 00:07:45,730
Howard's mother was around him all the time,

157
00:07:45,730 --> 00:07:49,300
and he's a world-class mama's boy.

158
00:07:50,060 --> 00:07:52,220
I mean, wh-why would you say that?

159
00:07:52,220 --> 00:07:55,920
Go ahead, have a tantrum; that'll prove me wrong.

160
00:07:58,310 --> 00:08:00,540
It would be nice to raise Halley to be a little more independent

161
00:08:00,540 --> 00:08:02,080
than you were.

162
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:03,320
I guess.

163
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:05,430
It wasn't until college that I learned

164
00:08:05,430 --> 00:08:09,270
you can put a thermometer in your mouth.

165
00:08:12,340 --> 00:08:16,630
On that charming note, dinner is served.

166
00:08:19,090 --> 00:08:21,070
So is this your first time dating a scientist?

167
00:08:21,070 --> 00:08:24,740
'Cause I'm thinking of starting a support group.

168
00:08:24,740 --> 00:08:26,350
Actually, I'm not new to this.

169
00:08:26,350 --> 00:08:30,790
I was engaged to a Scientologist.

171
00:08:33,910 --> 00:08:35,260
Bert, Rebecca.

172
00:08:35,260 --> 00:08:38,860
I'd like to apologize for my insensitive comment earlier.

173
00:08:38,860 --> 00:08:41,000
Don't worry about it. It's fine.

174
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,260
See? It was fine.

175
00:08:42,260 --> 00:08:44,700
I didn't need a time-out.

176
00:08:46,390 --> 00:08:48,850
It wasn't a time-out. Let's get some food.

177
00:08:48,850 --> 00:08:50,810
You made me sit on the stairs and think about what I did.

178
00:08:50,810 --> 00:08:52,760
Get your food!

179
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:57,030
So how did you two meet?

180
00:08:57,030 --> 00:08:59,350
Oh, it's such a cute story.

181
00:08:59,350 --> 00:09:01,530
We met on a dating Web site.

182
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:07,820
Is that it?

183
00:09:07,820 --> 00:09:11,280
Oh, sorry. The end.

184
00:09:13,310 --> 00:09:14,050
That's nice.

185
00:09:14,050 --> 00:09:17,230
I haven't had much success meeting people online.

186
00:09:17,230 --> 00:09:19,750
I didn't either, until I revamped my profile.

187
00:09:19,750 --> 00:09:22,940
What'd you do, delete your photo?

188
00:09:26,990 --> 00:09:29,360
- Go. - Fine.

189
00:09:31,740 --> 00:09:33,910
And don't you slam that door.

190
00:09:33,910 --> 00:09:36,590
Aw, man.

191
00:09:37,430 --> 00:09:38,960
Did I say something wrong?

192
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:41,730
No, it's always him.

193
00:09:42,830 --> 00:09:45,970
So, Bert, you were telling us how you updated your profile?

194
00:09:45,970 --> 00:09:49,010
Right. I wasn't getting any responses, and then I added,

195
00:09:49,010 --> 00:09:52,520
recent $625,000 MacArthur grant winner.

196
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:53,900
and five minutes later,

197
00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:56,800
I met my soul mate.

198
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:03,880
I was wrong. You can come back in.

199
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:11,300
So, Rebecca, how did you become a personal trainer?

200
00:10:11,300 --> 00:10:13,460
I came to Los Angeles to be an actress,

201
00:10:13,460 --> 00:10:15,570
and things didn't really work out.

202
00:10:15,570 --> 00:10:18,690
I'd say she's copying you again, but...

203
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:23,140
...I'm getting tired of sitting in the hall.

204
00:10:23,140 --> 00:10:25,250
I'd love a personal trainer.

205
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:27,370
I haven't seen my abs since they opened a Shake Shack

206
00:10:27,370 --> 00:10:30,270
on my drive home.

207
00:10:30,270 --> 00:10:31,960
I could give you some free sessions.

208
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:33,900
Oh, is that offer for everybody?

209
00:10:34,230 --> 00:10:37,350
Nice try. I'm not going.

210
00:10:39,490 --> 00:10:40,540
Where's your bathroom?

211
00:10:40,540 --> 00:10:42,510
Mm, just down there.

212
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:46,280
She's so perfect, sometimes I think she isn't real.

213
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:50,150
And then she goes to the bathroom, and I know she is.

214
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:54,540
Aw, that's so weird.

215
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:55,830
I'm sorry, Bert,

216
00:10:55,830 --> 00:10:58,410
but aren't you worried she's only with you for your money?

217
00:10:58,410 --> 00:11:00,050
She better be. On our first date,

218
00:11:00,050 --> 00:11:03,570
I bought her an 80-inch flat-screen.

219
00:11:03,570 --> 00:11:05,390
Your first date?

220
00:11:05,390 --> 00:11:09,510
Did you even measure her walls?

221
00:11:13,810 --> 00:11:14,970
You know, on our first date,

222
00:11:14,970 --> 00:11:18,620
Leonard used a coupon to buy me a pretzel.

223
00:11:18,620 --> 00:11:22,480
And we lived happily ever after.

224
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:24,860
The end.

225
00:11:27,380 --> 00:11:29,480
Well, guess I'm ready to go.

226
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:31,210
Have a great first day back.

227
00:11:31,210 --> 00:11:32,580
You have everything she needs for day care?

228
00:11:32,580 --> 00:11:34,290
Yep, all in the bag.

229
00:11:34,290 --> 00:11:35,610
Good.

230
00:11:35,610 --> 00:11:36,780
Okay, sweetie,

231
00:11:36,780 --> 00:11:39,250
Mommy's gonna go to work now, so you have fun today.

232
00:11:39,250 --> 00:11:41,090
I told her if day care is anything like prison,

233
00:11:41,090 --> 00:11:44,500
find the biggest baby and knock him out.

234
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:47,140
Bye, cutie.

235
00:11:47,140 --> 00:11:49,590
I'm gonna miss you.

236
00:11:50,210 --> 00:11:54,500
I'm gonna be waiting right here tonight when you get home.

237
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:58,520
Stop, you're gonna make me cry.

238
00:11:58,520 --> 00:12:01,640
Great, now everybody's crying.

239
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:03,580
At least Halley's not.

240
00:12:03,580 --> 00:12:05,090
That's good.

241
00:12:05,090 --> 00:12:09,310
She's not gonna see us all day, and she doesn't even care!

242
00:12:11,220 --> 00:12:12,850
Who's ready to laugh?

243
00:12:13,330 --> 00:12:14,750
Okay. So...

244
00:12:14,750 --> 00:12:18,680
Feynman, Einstein and Schrodinger walk into a bar.

245
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:19,950
Feynman says,

246
00:12:19,950 --> 00:12:22,150
It appears we're inside a joke.

247
00:12:22,150 --> 00:12:24,830
Einstein replies, but only to an observer

248
00:12:24,830 --> 00:12:27,040
who saw us walk in simultaneously.

249
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:28,690
To which Schrodinger says,

251
00:12:28,690 --> 00:12:32,010
if someone's looking in the window, I'm leaving.

252
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:37,600
That's actually funny.

253
00:12:38,830 --> 00:12:42,490
You should send that to Jimmy Fallon.

254
00:12:43,700 --> 00:12:45,590
Oh, hello. Join us.

255
00:12:45,970 --> 00:12:48,550
Hey, sorry if last night was awkward.

256
00:12:48,550 --> 00:12:50,050
Actually, it got me thinking

257
00:12:50,050 --> 00:12:52,630
that I shouldn't flaunt my money to find love.

258
00:12:52,630 --> 00:12:54,730
I might break up with Rebecca.

259
00:12:54,730 --> 00:12:56,340
Wow, that's a big step.

260
00:12:56,340 --> 00:12:58,330
I think it shows a lot of character.

261
00:12:58,330 --> 00:13:00,280
I'm gonna hold out and see if I can find

262
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:02,860
a hot young blonde who likes me for me.

263
00:13:03,270 --> 00:13:05,410
That's a good one.

264
00:13:09,330 --> 00:13:11,660
Okay, now, Leonard, you tell a joke.

265
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:16,280
How's she doing?

266
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:18,690
She's great. Look.

267
00:13:19,770 --> 00:13:20,940
I see a wall...

268
00:13:20,940 --> 00:13:22,340
floor...

269
00:13:22,340 --> 00:13:24,310
some Asian baby...

270
00:13:24,580 --> 00:13:25,910
There she is.

271
00:13:25,910 --> 00:13:28,150
See? Nothing to worry about.

272
00:13:28,150 --> 00:13:29,270
Thank you.

273
00:13:29,270 --> 00:13:31,090
Okay, I'm gonna try and get some work done.

274
00:13:31,090 --> 00:13:33,410
Yeah, me, too. Love you.

275
00:13:33,410 --> 00:13:35,320
Love you, too. Bye.

276
00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:44,660
How is she?

277
00:13:48,270 --> 00:13:49,820
What are you doing here?

278
00:13:49,820 --> 00:13:52,100
Can't a guy hang out at a college he doesn't go to

279
00:13:52,100 --> 00:13:55,680
and stare at a baby that isn't his?

280
00:13:56,180 --> 00:13:57,510
I get it.

281
00:13:57,510 --> 00:14:01,210
I haven't even made it to my office yet.

282
00:14:06,690 --> 00:14:09,810
Is it weird if we just stand here and watch her all day?

283
00:14:09,810 --> 00:14:12,290
Probably.

284
00:14:14,290 --> 00:14:15,740
We should go.

285
00:14:15,740 --> 00:14:18,060
Yeah.

286
00:14:19,420 --> 00:14:21,780
Or we could take her to the aquarium.

287
00:14:21,780 --> 00:14:24,350
I'll get her, you grab her bag.

288
00:14:24,350 --> 00:14:28,160
Hang on, Halley, we're busting you out of there!

289
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:31,450
What are you looking at?

290
00:14:31,450 --> 00:14:34,240
Comments from our Behind the Flags retrospective.

291
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:35,900
Get this, people are calling it

292
00:14:35,900 --> 00:14:39,180
the longest one yet.

293
00:14:41,340 --> 00:14:42,940
Hello? Anybody home?

294
00:14:42,940 --> 00:14:43,880
Is that Bert?

295
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:44,810
It's Bert.

296
00:14:44,810 --> 00:14:47,350
I think it's Bert.

297
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:50,040
Hey, what's up?

298
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:52,580
I broke up with Rebecca.

299
00:14:53,460 --> 00:14:54,970
You know, good for you.

300
00:14:54,970 --> 00:14:57,330
No, I miss her.

301
00:14:57,330 --> 00:14:59,860
I don't know why I listened to you.

302
00:14:59,860 --> 00:15:02,310
He's not wrong.

303
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:06,920
It was your crackpot idea that he deserves love.

304
00:15:08,090 --> 00:15:09,500
You know, you need to start raising your hand

305
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:11,540
before you speak.

306
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:15,580
Yes, starting now.

307
00:15:16,220 --> 00:15:17,830
Bert, you're a good guy; you deserve a woman

308
00:15:17,830 --> 00:15:20,000
who's interested in more than just your money.

309
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,160
She was also interested in walking around my house

310
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:23,230
in her underwear.

311
00:15:23,230 --> 00:15:26,940
Now the only one doing that is me.

312
00:15:28,790 --> 00:15:31,590
If you're that upset, go get her back.

313
00:15:31,590 --> 00:15:32,800
I tried.

314
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:34,750
She's not answering my calls.

315
00:15:34,750 --> 00:15:39,390
Which really hurts because I bought her that phone.

316
00:15:39,990 --> 00:15:41,700
I made a huge mistake.

317
00:15:41,700 --> 00:15:43,660
No, you didn't. Okay?

318
00:15:43,660 --> 00:15:45,900
Look, Bert, when I had money,

319
00:15:45,900 --> 00:15:47,950
I dated lots of girls who weren't right for me.

320
00:15:47,950 --> 00:15:49,190
And then I gave up my money,

321
00:15:49,190 --> 00:15:51,390
and now I'm alone and living with my friends,

322
00:15:51,390 --> 00:15:55,770
and somebody else should probably talk now.

323
00:15:57,070 --> 00:15:58,460
Look, sweetie,

324
00:15:58,460 --> 00:16:00,270
relationships aren't about money, okay?

325
00:16:00,270 --> 00:16:02,880
It's about respect and having things in common

326
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:03,990
and...

327
00:16:03,990 --> 00:16:05,300
Yes, Sheldon?

328
00:16:05,300 --> 00:16:07,100
You and Leonard don't have anything in common.

329
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:09,880
Maybe you should break up.

330
00:16:10,900 --> 00:16:13,930
You called on him.

331
00:16:16,350 --> 00:16:20,540
Guess who's home from day care?

332
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:23,050
It's Halley.

333
00:16:23,050 --> 00:16:26,730
Unless somebody else put an X on the bottom of their kid's foot.

334
00:16:27,330 --> 00:16:30,110
You realize they called when you took her.

335
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:36,210
Guess who's home from the aquarium?

336
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:40,870
Sorry again for barging in.

337
00:16:40,870 --> 00:16:42,660
You don't have to go. You're welcome to hang with us.

338
00:16:42,660 --> 00:16:45,880
Actually, our friendship group is at capacity.

339
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:50,070
But if anybody drops out, you're at the top of the list.

340
00:16:50,830 --> 00:16:52,310
Unless it's Raj,

341
00:16:52,310 --> 00:16:55,810
in which case, we'll probably get a person of color.

342
00:16:58,690 --> 00:17:00,390
You guys are nice, but I'm just gonna

343
00:17:00,390 --> 00:17:04,590
buy Rebecca a Jet Ski and see if that gets her back.

344
00:17:05,850 --> 00:17:07,730
I feel bad for Bert.

345
00:17:07,730 --> 00:17:10,370
So he's using his money to attract a mate.

346
00:17:10,370 --> 00:17:12,180
Is that any different than me using my intelligence

347
00:17:12,180 --> 00:17:13,420
to attract Amy?

348
00:17:13,420 --> 00:17:17,320
Or Leonard using his power of groveling to get Penny?

349
00:17:18,210 --> 00:17:19,620
It's totally different.

350
00:17:19,620 --> 00:17:20,640
Bert's money might run out,

351
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:23,940
but I can beg until the end of time.

352
00:17:25,570 --> 00:17:29,850
All that and he's shorter than me.

353
00:17:31,420 --> 00:17:34,730
Sheldon, what did Amy have that attracted you?

354
00:17:34,730 --> 00:17:36,660
Oh, so many things.

355
00:17:36,660 --> 00:17:39,320
Her mind, her kindness,

356
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:41,950
and especially her body.

357
00:17:41,950 --> 00:17:43,370
Really?

358
00:17:43,370 --> 00:17:44,930
Relax. We're the same blood type.

359
00:17:44,930 --> 00:17:48,240
He knew he could harvest an organ.

360
00:17:56,870 --> 00:17:58,730
She does look happy.

361
00:17:58,730 --> 00:18:01,210
See? This is the right thing for her.

362
00:18:01,210 --> 00:18:03,700
Let's all just go to work.

363
00:18:09,570 --> 00:18:11,790
Anytime.

364
00:18:12,830 --> 00:18:14,930
Let me just say good-bye.

365
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:18,830
Halley. Look at Mommy.

366
00:18:19,830 --> 00:18:22,040
Over here, honey.

367
00:18:23,260 --> 00:18:25,550
Say good-bye to Mommy!

368
00:18:26,610 --> 00:18:27,600
Look at me!

369
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:30,570
Look at your mother!

370
00:18:32,990 --> 00:18:35,100
All right, we can go.

371
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:39,270
Hello.

372
00:18:39,270 --> 00:18:40,820
I'm Dr. Sheldon Cooper.

373
00:18:40,820 --> 00:18:42,960
And I'm Dr. Amy Farrah Fowler.

374
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:44,440
Based on the glowing reception

375
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:47,000
of our recent Behind the Flags retrospective,

376
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,940
we thought you might like to see how it all came together.

377
00:18:49,940 --> 00:18:52,500
So welcome to tonight's episode...

378
00:18:53,470 --> 00:18:54,710
Fun with Flags:

379
00:18:54,710 --> 00:18:56,450
Behind the Behind the Flags:

380
00:18:56,450 --> 00:19:00,380
A Retrospective Retrospective.

381
00:19:01,110 --> 00:19:03,020
Ooh, we already have our first call.

382
00:19:04,570 --> 00:19:07,410
Hello, you're on Fun with Flags.

383
00:19:07,410 --> 00:19:10,730
The Jet Ski worked. I got her back.
