1
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:04,620
If we're going to be staying in this apartment,

2
00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:08,350
would you be interested in doing a little redecorating?

3
00:00:08,350 --> 00:00:11,640
Oh, actually, I would.

4
00:00:11,650 --> 00:00:13,510
Great, what'd you have in mind?

5
00:00:13,780 --> 00:00:16,660
Let's take every single thing from the other apartment

6
00:00:16,660 --> 00:00:18,930
and put it in here.

7
00:00:19,390 --> 00:00:21,210
Well, how about we start a little smaller?

8
00:00:21,210 --> 00:00:24,400
Like moving the furniture around.

9
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:25,980
You know, I have always thought

10
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:27,780
that this couch would look fantastic

11
00:00:27,780 --> 00:00:30,740
on the curb in front of the building.

12
00:00:31,390 --> 00:00:33,980
Look, we can't just throw away Penny's stuff,

13
00:00:33,980 --> 00:00:38,210
but we can ask if she wants any of it back.

14
00:00:38,810 --> 00:00:42,330
You know, I wonder how she feels about all this artwork.

15
00:00:42,330 --> 00:00:45,260
Well, I'm sure she misses this one.

16
00:00:45,260 --> 00:00:49,500
I mean, it's the greatest gift I've ever given anybody.

17
00:00:55,290 --> 00:00:59,540
It truly does capture the beauty of your friendship with Penny.

18
00:01:00,290 --> 00:01:02,760
It may have appreciated in value.

19
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:06,540
The artist killed himself shortly after painting that.

20
00:01:06,870 --> 00:01:10,670
Yeah, it seems only right that she have it back.

21
00:01:10,670 --> 00:01:12,110
I can't wait to see the look on her face

22
00:01:12,110 --> 00:01:15,100
when I give it to her again.

23
00:01:20,300 --> 00:01:24,220
Look, it's the same smile she has in the painting.

24
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:51,690
Yeah-- there's hooks in the closet,

25
00:01:51,690 --> 00:01:52,870
I can hang it right now.

26
00:01:52,870 --> 00:01:54,790
Oh, no, no, Th-those hooks are gone.

27
00:01:54,790 --> 00:01:56,020
What happened to them?

28
00:01:56,030 --> 00:01:58,060
Uh, we ran out of candy on Halloween,

29
00:01:58,060 --> 00:02:00,750
I was just giving everything away.

30
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:03,260
Hey, guys, what are you...?

31
00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:05,600
Oh, that's here, cool.

32
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:07,840
Amy wants me to have it.

33
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:09,770
Well, it would be selfish of me to keep it.

34
00:02:09,770 --> 00:02:11,770
B-But it's a picture of you.

35
00:02:11,770 --> 00:02:13,640
And you.

36
00:02:14,410 --> 00:02:15,680
But you commissioned it.

37
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:18,030
To give to you.

38
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:20,070
But you like it so much.

39
00:02:20,070 --> 00:02:22,320
So do you.

40
00:02:23,670 --> 00:02:24,790
I seem to be losing.

41
00:02:24,790 --> 00:02:26,440
Yes, you do.

42
00:02:27,250 --> 00:02:29,190
You know, Leonard, the more I think about it,

43
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:31,860
there are a number of mutually owned items in this apartment

44
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:33,330
that you and I should go through.

45
00:02:33,330 --> 00:02:35,020
Uh, for example...

46
00:02:35,730 --> 00:02:37,970
who gets our beloved sword, Longclaw?

47
00:02:37,970 --> 00:02:38,970
Why don't you keep it?

48
00:02:38,970 --> 00:02:41,730
That seems fair; we did just give you the painting.

49
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:45,830
Yeah, I don't need anything around that I can stab myself with.

50
00:02:46,150 --> 00:02:48,280
Wonderful, Longclaw is mine.

51
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:51,070
And how about you keep our...

52
00:02:51,070 --> 00:02:53,250
avocado plant?

53
00:02:56,380 --> 00:02:59,080
Sounds right-- a limited edition collectible

54
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:00,690
worth hundreds of dollars

55
00:03:00,690 --> 00:03:04,950
and a thing that grew out of a thing we fished from the trash.

56
00:03:05,290 --> 00:03:07,680
Although, Amy and I did just move in together,

57
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:10,510
and a plant is a lovely housewarming gift.

58
00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:12,330
Fine, take the plant.

59
00:03:12,330 --> 00:03:13,830
Oh, we got a sword and a plant;

60
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:16,130
our apartment's really shaping up.

61
00:03:18,910 --> 00:03:21,430
Stuart, you didn't have to get us a baby gift.

62
00:03:21,980 --> 00:03:24,570
Just homemade coupons for things you might need help with

63
00:03:24,570 --> 00:03:26,270
before the baby gets here.

64
00:03:26,270 --> 00:03:29,020
Going to the grocery store, driving you to the doctor.

65
00:03:29,020 --> 00:03:32,340
If you're not in a hurry, I can dig you a koi pond.

66
00:03:34,650 --> 00:03:36,120
A foot massage?

67
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:39,790
And that's not me being creepy, that's for either of you.

68
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:44,980
This is very nice, Stuart, thank you.

69
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:47,950
How come this one's on the back of an eviction notice?

70
00:03:47,950 --> 00:03:51,530
Oh, yeah. Uh, now that you mention it...

71
00:03:51,530 --> 00:03:53,870
can I live here?

72
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:57,750
Stuart, we'd love to help you out,

73
00:03:57,750 --> 00:04:00,780
but this a bad time; we're about to have a baby.

74
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:02,520
Or is that why this is a great time?

75
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:04,520
Think about it-- when that baby comes,

76
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:06,660
you're gonna need all the help you can get.

77
00:04:07,050 --> 00:04:07,640
Thank you,

78
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:10,160
but I'm not really sure.

79
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:12,630
Hang on, maybe it's not the worst idea.

80
00:04:12,630 --> 00:04:15,620
I mean, he did do a good job taking care of my mother.

81
00:04:15,620 --> 00:04:17,270
That woman didn't get heat rash once

82
00:04:17,270 --> 00:04:19,780
with me on powder patrol.

83
00:04:22,890 --> 00:04:24,470
I guess you could stay for a few days

84
00:04:24,470 --> 00:04:25,770
and we'll see how it goes.

85
00:04:25,780 --> 00:04:27,240
Thank you.

86
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:28,840
And it's only temporary,

87
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:30,710
just till I get back on my feet.

88
00:04:30,710 --> 00:04:32,130
or the baby goes off to college,

89
00:04:32,130 --> 00:04:34,230
whichever happens first.

90
00:04:36,340 --> 00:04:37,980
When would you move in?

91
00:04:37,980 --> 00:04:40,490
Well, uh, my car broke down in your driveway,

92
00:04:40,490 --> 00:04:43,170
so I'm gonna say now.

93
00:04:43,790 --> 00:04:45,690
But I am ready to be helpful.

94
00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:46,410
In fact...

95
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:48,530
I'm gonna go vacuum.

96
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:52,360
Actually I just did that this morning.

97
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:53,570
Okay.

98
00:04:53,570 --> 00:04:54,840
Then I'll dust.

99
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:56,800
I did that, too.

100
00:04:57,250 --> 00:05:00,800
Then I'll check the batteries in the smoke detectors.

101
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,530
Howard just did that.

102
00:05:02,530 --> 00:05:05,870
Yeah, let him do it.

103
00:05:10,260 --> 00:05:13,510
Remember when we got this at Comic-Con?

104
00:05:13,510 --> 00:05:14,760
Oh, yeah.

105
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:17,390
The Mr. Spock cuckoo clock.

106
00:05:17,710 --> 00:05:21,130
Live long and prosper. Live long and prosper.

107
00:05:21,130 --> 00:05:22,900
Live long and prosper.

108
00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:24,900
Live long and prosper.

109
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:27,380
It's one of a kind.

110
00:05:27,380 --> 00:05:30,830
So if it breaks there'd be none of it?

111
00:05:31,670 --> 00:05:32,810
Well, Leonard,

112
00:05:32,810 --> 00:05:34,500
you know, who should keep this?

113
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:37,840
On the one hand, I love Mr. Spock more than you do.

114
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:41,730
On the other hand, I care more about clocks than you do.

115
00:05:41,730 --> 00:05:43,230
So you think you should keep it?

116
00:05:43,230 --> 00:05:44,490
I'll be right across the hall.

117
00:05:44,490 --> 00:05:47,060
You'll probably be able to hear it.

118
00:05:48,860 --> 00:05:50,340
Keep the clock, Sheldon.

119
00:05:50,340 --> 00:05:51,260
Thank you.

120
00:05:51,260 --> 00:05:54,120
- Thank you. - Thank you?

121
00:05:54,730 --> 00:05:56,460
Oh, now...

122
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:59,770
what about our 3-D chess set?

123
00:05:59,770 --> 00:06:00,930
Let me guess, you want it.

124
00:06:00,940 --> 00:06:01,990
Well, no,

125
00:06:01,990 --> 00:06:04,000
I just didn't think you'd want a physical reminder

126
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,220
of a game you never managed to win.

127
00:06:06,220 --> 00:06:09,770
As a kindness, I should probably take all the games.

128
00:06:09,770 --> 00:06:11,480
You know what, Sheldon, take it.

129
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:12,890
In fact, you can have everything.

130
00:06:12,890 --> 00:06:14,780
I really don't care.

131
00:06:14,780 --> 00:06:16,290
Are you sure?

132
00:06:16,290 --> 00:06:18,820
These items represent our shared times together.

133
00:06:18,820 --> 00:06:20,330
- Well, now they're yours. - Leonard....

134
00:06:20,330 --> 00:06:21,610
Well, you know what's gonna happen.

135
00:06:21,610 --> 00:06:23,020
He's just gonna come up with some reason

136
00:06:23,020 --> 00:06:24,820
why everything should be his.

137
00:06:24,820 --> 00:06:26,590
For a man so good at predicting my moves,

138
00:06:26,590 --> 00:06:29,210
how come you stink at 3-D chess?

139
00:06:30,250 --> 00:06:32,410
Sheldon, you're-you're being a little selfish.

140
00:06:32,410 --> 00:06:34,800
Why don't you let Leonard keep a few things?

141
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,100
It's not my fault I'm bad at sharing;

142
00:06:36,110 --> 00:06:38,540
I skipped kindergarten.

143
00:06:38,540 --> 00:06:39,400
You know what?

144
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:41,820
There is one thing I would like.

145
00:06:41,820 --> 00:06:44,130
Yeah, take whatever you want.

146
00:06:44,130 --> 00:06:46,290
I would like to keep...

147
00:06:46,290 --> 00:06:49,990
the official flag of our apartment.

148
00:06:50,780 --> 00:06:52,120
But you don't even like flags.

149
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:54,340
Yeah, I like this one.

150
00:06:56,150 --> 00:06:58,140
But I designed it.

151
00:06:58,140 --> 00:07:01,610
But you made me order it because you were "Too well-known"

152
00:07:01,610 --> 00:07:05,900
in the flag community and they'd jack up the price.

153
00:07:05,900 --> 00:07:08,500
But you don't even understand its symbolism.

154
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:09,360
Oh, I do.

155
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:12,720
The-the field of blue represents you being miserable,

156
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:15,270
and the lion sticking its tongue out means

157
00:07:15,270 --> 00:07:17,540
I'm happy about it.

158
00:07:20,270 --> 00:07:22,250
Come along, Amy.

159
00:07:22,730 --> 00:07:25,200
I know when I'm not wanted.

160
00:07:26,220 --> 00:07:28,980
I don't think you do, but all right.

161
00:07:33,250 --> 00:07:35,160
Stuart, you cooked?

162
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:36,900
How did you know it wasn't me?

163
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:38,600
There's only three people in this house,

164
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:41,580
and you'd still be my fifth guess.

165
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:45,270
That's Raj.

166
00:07:45,270 --> 00:07:46,310
You guys relax,

167
00:07:46,310 --> 00:07:47,770
I'll get it.

168
00:07:47,770 --> 00:07:50,540
Have some bread while it's still warm.

169
00:07:51,510 --> 00:07:52,880
It's like we have a butler.

170
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:55,990
If I had a Batsuit I'd be Bruce Wayne.

171
00:07:56,900 --> 00:07:59,330
You have a Batsuit.

172
00:07:59,890 --> 00:08:02,580
It's pajamas, there's no cape.

173
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:05,330
Hey, Raj.

174
00:08:05,330 --> 00:08:07,210
Hey, Stuart. What are you doing here?

175
00:08:07,210 --> 00:08:08,800
Oh, I'm living here again.

176
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:11,600
Do, uh, Howard and Bernadette know?

177
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:15,950
Or is it like a possum in the walls kind of thing?

178
00:08:17,030 --> 00:08:19,680
No, I needed a place to stay

179
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:20,740
and, with the baby coming,

180
00:08:20,740 --> 00:08:22,620
I figured they could use some extra help.

181
00:08:23,020 --> 00:08:24,600
Okay, cool.

182
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:26,120
Anyway, come on in, dinner's ready.

183
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:28,050
Oh, but I bought Chinese takeout.

184
00:08:28,050 --> 00:08:29,970
Oh, okay.

185
00:08:29,970 --> 00:08:33,190
Well, if Bernadette wants her ankles to swell up even more,

186
00:08:33,190 --> 00:08:34,960
she can have that.

187
00:08:39,170 --> 00:08:41,210
Is the Wi-Fi working for you?

188
00:08:41,210 --> 00:08:43,760
Uh, hang on.

189
00:08:43,770 --> 00:08:45,320
I don't think so, I'm clicking on

190
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:46,930
"One weird trick for a flat belly,"

191
00:08:46,940 --> 00:08:47,730
but I'm still seeing

192
00:08:47,730 --> 00:08:50,780
"Celebrities who look like their pets."

193
00:08:52,140 --> 00:08:53,200
Oh, I knew it,

194
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:54,720
Sheldon changed the password.

195
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:55,590
Are you sure?

196
00:08:55,590 --> 00:08:57,510
Well, the new network name is,

197
00:08:57,510 --> 00:09:01,320
"Ha ha ha, now I've got you," so...

198
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:06,420
It's either Sheldon or Gargamel from The Smurfs.

199
00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:08,060
What a jerk.

200
00:09:08,060 --> 00:09:10,560
You're good at revenge; how do we get him back?

201
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:11,970
Well, my go-to move is usually

202
00:09:11,970 --> 00:09:13,530
sleep with the person's boyfriend,

203
00:09:13,530 --> 00:09:17,070
but I kind of feel like I'm already doing that.

204
00:09:24,010 --> 00:09:25,030
Sheldon, I know what you did,

205
00:09:25,030 --> 00:09:27,790
now change the password back.

206
00:09:28,790 --> 00:09:31,950
Well, powder me in sugar and call me a donut,

207
00:09:31,950 --> 00:09:34,950
if it isn't Leonard Hofstadter.

208
00:09:35,450 --> 00:09:36,500
Sheldon, I'm warning you,

209
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:38,290
I can play this game, too.

210
00:09:38,290 --> 00:09:40,190
If it's like your 3-D chess game,

211
00:09:40,190 --> 00:09:43,270
then you're out of your length, width and depth.

212
00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:45,930
Amy, get the Neosporin,

213
00:09:45,930 --> 00:09:48,050
somebody just got burned.

214
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:51,970
All right, I tried.

215
00:09:51,970 --> 00:09:54,200
"All right, I tried."

216
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:57,290
That should be the title of your autobiography.

217
00:09:58,140 --> 00:10:01,230
Ooh, a second-degree burn.

218
00:10:02,180 --> 00:10:02,890
I've got the Neosporin.

219
00:10:02,890 --> 00:10:04,430
Who got hurt?

220
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:07,250
It's a good thing you're cute.

221
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:18,290
So, I was reading how it's a good idea for new parents

222
00:10:18,290 --> 00:10:20,460
to take an infant CPR class.

223
00:10:20,460 --> 00:10:22,930
Yeah, we've been meaning to do that.

224
00:10:22,930 --> 00:10:25,700
Oh, I know a CPR instructor who'll come to the house.

225
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:27,640
- That'd be great. - I'll give him a call.

226
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:29,340
We met when I was sleeping on the beach

227
00:10:29,340 --> 00:10:31,100
and he thought I was dead.

228
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:34,950
Thank you again for cooking.

229
00:10:34,950 --> 00:10:37,340
It's getting tough for me to be on my feet all day.

230
00:10:37,340 --> 00:10:38,400
You just kick back and relax;

231
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:40,470
I've got it all under control.

232
00:10:41,220 --> 00:10:43,840
Although it was already under control.

233
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:47,350
I'm sorry, you mumbled something?

234
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:51,760
It's just that they've had plenty of help.

235
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:52,990
Well, you know what they say --

236
00:10:52,990 --> 00:10:54,260
it takes a village.

237
00:10:54,260 --> 00:10:57,060
Well, they already had a village.

238
00:10:57,870 --> 00:11:01,160
I noticed the village couldn't find time to put the crib together.

239
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:03,980
Yeah, well, maybe the village was too busy checking out

240
00:11:03,980 --> 00:11:06,270
the local Montessori school for the new arrival.

241
00:11:06,270 --> 00:11:08,460
You mean the one with the empty beer bottles in the sandbox?

242
00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:10,720
We'll pass, thank you.

243
00:11:12,210 --> 00:11:15,120
Do something, Batman.

244
00:11:23,790 --> 00:11:25,630
What do you think you're doing?

245
00:11:25,630 --> 00:11:28,340
Separating my delicates.

246
00:11:29,970 --> 00:11:31,720
This is the level you're stooping to.

247
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:32,600
No.

248
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:37,760
This is the level I am stooping to.

249
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:45,860
I believe that is flag to crotch four, checkmate.

250
00:11:46,750 --> 00:11:50,360
Easy-peasy, ooh, so breezy.

251
00:11:59,410 --> 00:12:00,560
Hey, what's up?

252
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:01,850
I'm here to put the crib together.

253
00:12:01,850 --> 00:12:04,080
Ooh, sorry, I already did it.

254
00:12:04,580 --> 00:12:06,020
Oh, I don't know if you realize this,

255
00:12:06,020 --> 00:12:07,660
but I bought that crib.

256
00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:12,490
Oh, yeah, I read about that on WhoGivesACrap.Com

257
00:12:13,710 --> 00:12:16,030
Why are you being like this?

258
00:12:16,030 --> 00:12:18,060
Because I love Howard and Bernadette

259
00:12:18,060 --> 00:12:21,440
and if I want to keep mooching off them, I need to be helpful.

260
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:23,730
Hey, this pregnancy had an emotionally-needy

261
00:12:23,730 --> 00:12:26,570
third wheel way before you came along.

262
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:30,740
Why can't there be four wheels?

263
00:12:30,740 --> 00:12:32,220
Is this what you do when I'm not here,

264
00:12:32,220 --> 00:12:34,670
make really good points?

265
00:12:34,950 --> 00:12:38,540
Look-Look, just come in and help me build a baby swing.

266
00:12:38,550 --> 00:12:40,240
Thank you.

267
00:12:40,570 --> 00:12:41,720
If you're hungry you can eat your takeout;

268
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:43,800
nobody touched it.

269
00:12:46,310 --> 00:12:47,190
I think I'm gonna go for a run.

270
00:12:47,190 --> 00:12:48,520
You want to come?

271
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:51,330
No, last time that old lady in the park kept screaming,

272
00:12:51,330 --> 00:12:54,000
"Watch out, he's right behind you."

273
00:12:58,390 --> 00:12:59,330
Hello?

274
00:12:59,330 --> 00:13:02,760
Hey, how you doing?

275
00:13:03,630 --> 00:13:05,760
Uh, can I help you?

276
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:09,750
I don't think so, but you're sweet for asking.

277
00:13:10,290 --> 00:13:12,390
What-What are you doing in our apartment?

278
00:13:12,390 --> 00:13:17,400
Oh, I rented a room from your neighbor, the tall guy...

279
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:20,080
dressed like a little boy.

280
00:13:21,220 --> 00:13:22,190
Unbelievable.

281
00:13:22,190 --> 00:13:24,690
Okay, uh, I don't know what he told you,

282
00:13:24,690 --> 00:13:26,120
but you can't stay here.

283
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:29,060
So, there are fresh linens on the bed and...

284
00:13:29,930 --> 00:13:32,660
Well, now, I see you've met Theodore.

285
00:13:33,470 --> 00:13:36,240
Theodore, these are your new roommates,

286
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:37,560
Leonard and Penny.

287
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:38,810
They're very honest,

288
00:13:38,810 --> 00:13:41,340
but I would not leave cash lying around.

289
00:13:42,100 --> 00:13:44,150
Sheldon, what do you think you're doing?

290
00:13:44,150 --> 00:13:46,350
My room is paid up until the end of the month,

291
00:13:46,350 --> 00:13:48,390
so I can do with it whatever I please,

292
00:13:48,390 --> 00:13:51,330
which includes renting it out for a dollar a night.

293
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:54,000
It's like the '40s again.

294
00:13:56,590 --> 00:13:59,290
Anyway, I'll leave you be.

295
00:13:59,290 --> 00:14:00,490
I have to...

296
00:14:00,490 --> 00:14:02,780
He's expecting a newspaper in the morning.

297
00:14:02,780 --> 00:14:05,550
Apparently, they still make them.

298
00:14:05,550 --> 00:14:07,600
All right, Sheldon, this is over the line.

299
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:08,480
That's true,

300
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:10,580
but had I done something under the line,

301
00:14:10,580 --> 00:14:12,050
there wouldn't be a man in your kitchen

302
00:14:12,050 --> 00:14:14,360
who can't produce a single form of ID.

303
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:16,590
Oh, oh, I have a receipt from a blood bank.

304
00:14:17,060 --> 00:14:20,180
I'm O-negative.

305
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:25,350
And now you know as much about him as I do.

306
00:14:28,620 --> 00:14:30,690
Oh, hey, Bernadette,

307
00:14:30,690 --> 00:14:33,790
the swing comes with two different mobiles.

308
00:14:33,790 --> 00:14:36,750
The giraffes are pretty cute, what do you think?

309
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:38,480
Great, go with the giraffes.

310
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:39,480
Although...

311
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:41,140
the high contrast of zebra stripes

312
00:14:41,140 --> 00:14:44,380
might provide better stimulus for a developing baby.

313
00:14:45,980 --> 00:14:48,590
Yeah, you're probably right, go with the zebras.

314
00:14:48,590 --> 00:14:50,730
Good choice, boss.

315
00:14:52,980 --> 00:14:56,380
At least my nose is naturally brown.

316
00:14:59,330 --> 00:15:01,770
Hey, could you please go to the market for me?

317
00:15:01,770 --> 00:15:03,600
Get Stuart or Raj to do it.

318
00:15:03,950 --> 00:15:06,340
Howie, they've been doing everything for you.

319
00:15:06,340 --> 00:15:06,990
Mm, I know.

320
00:15:06,990 --> 00:15:10,270
It's really making me lose respect for both of them.

321
00:15:11,250 --> 00:15:13,080
Please just go to the store.

322
00:15:13,540 --> 00:15:15,060
Fine.

323
00:15:16,150 --> 00:15:17,950
Who wants to drive me to the store?

324
00:15:17,950 --> 00:15:19,560
- Me! - I'll do it!

325
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:20,680
Take Raj.

326
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:23,680
Stuart is supposed to paint my toenails.

327
00:15:34,620 --> 00:15:35,710
What do you think?

328
00:15:35,710 --> 00:15:37,180
Should we go to a hotel?

329
00:15:37,180 --> 00:15:39,030
And just leave him here alone?

330
00:15:39,030 --> 00:15:40,340
Okay, I'll go to a hotel.

331
00:15:40,340 --> 00:15:43,230
Text me in the morning if you're still alive.

332
00:15:45,590 --> 00:15:47,070
Uh, Theodore,

333
00:15:47,070 --> 00:15:50,490
how long are you planning to stay exactly?

334
00:15:50,490 --> 00:15:53,230
Oh, thanks to the coins I found in your couch,

335
00:15:53,230 --> 00:15:55,640
a day longer than I thought.

336
00:15:56,230 --> 00:15:58,340
This is ridiculous.

337
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:02,780
I like the painting.

338
00:16:03,660 --> 00:16:05,340
Is that your mom?

339
00:16:09,490 --> 00:16:12,190
Sheldon, get out here!

340
00:16:13,060 --> 00:16:14,660
Will you keep it down?

341
00:16:14,660 --> 00:16:16,330
What kind of vengeful bed and breakfast

342
00:16:16,330 --> 00:16:18,040
do you think I'm running?

343
00:16:18,750 --> 00:16:20,650
We lived together 13 years.

344
00:16:20,650 --> 00:16:22,480
How can you be so awful to me?

345
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:23,740
I'm being awful?!

346
00:16:23,740 --> 00:16:25,780
You're the one who went out of your way to hurt me.

347
00:16:25,780 --> 00:16:27,340
Because you were being selfish.

348
00:16:27,340 --> 00:16:29,370
Dividing our belongings is difficult.

349
00:16:29,370 --> 00:16:31,390
Why? I said I didn't care!

350
00:16:31,390 --> 00:16:33,100
Excuse me.

351
00:16:33,100 --> 00:16:35,900
It's none of my business, but it sounds like a lot

352
00:16:35,900 --> 00:16:40,130
of this anger is coming from love.

353
00:16:42,110 --> 00:16:44,500
Yeah, thanks, but nobody asked you.

354
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:48,100
Well, I'm just gonna keep on talking.

355
00:16:48,790 --> 00:16:51,220
Seems like, with Sheldon moving out,

356
00:16:51,220 --> 00:16:55,440
you're in a new phase of your lives

357
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:59,020
and it's easier to fight than to face the feelings

358
00:16:59,020 --> 00:17:02,070
that you have for one another.

359
00:17:03,850 --> 00:17:05,910
I think he might be right.

360
00:17:05,910 --> 00:17:07,920
Also, who is that?

361
00:17:09,990 --> 00:17:11,820
I have to admit,

362
00:17:11,820 --> 00:17:13,570
leaving you to move in with Amy

363
00:17:13,570 --> 00:17:16,120
has been harder than I thought it would be.

364
00:17:16,120 --> 00:17:17,570
Well, for me, too.

365
00:17:17,570 --> 00:17:19,230
It's not the same with you gone.

366
00:17:19,230 --> 00:17:21,020
If you're looking for a new guy to live with...

367
00:17:21,020 --> 00:17:23,170
-No! - We're good. Thank you.

368
00:17:24,260 --> 00:17:26,900
So, no one's gonna tell me? Okay.

369
00:17:27,710 --> 00:17:28,860
Leonard, I would like us to

370
00:17:28,860 --> 00:17:31,270
stop fighting about our possessions.

371
00:17:31,270 --> 00:17:32,670
Well, I'd like that, too.

372
00:17:32,670 --> 00:17:36,010
In fact, I want you to keep the apartment flag,

373
00:17:36,010 --> 00:17:37,310
and I'm not just saying that

374
00:17:37,310 --> 00:17:39,850
because it touched your genitals.

375
00:17:40,540 --> 00:17:41,250
You promise?

376
00:17:41,250 --> 00:17:42,250
I do.

377
00:17:42,250 --> 00:17:44,080
And to show you that there are no hard feelings,

378
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:48,560
I am willing to rub my genitals on it as well.

379
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:49,470
Well...

380
00:17:49,470 --> 00:17:54,520
if we're rubbing genitals on things, that's where I shine.

381
00:17:59,910 --> 00:18:02,550
Little lower to the left.

382
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:04,880
A little more.

383
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:07,130
Is it good?

384
00:18:07,130 --> 00:18:09,680
No, still hideous.

385
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:15,460
Well, I'm sure at some point,

386
00:18:15,460 --> 00:18:17,220
we won't even notice it's there.

387
00:18:17,220 --> 00:18:18,050
Yeah, you'd think that,

388
00:18:18,050 --> 00:18:21,870
but after a while it starts showing up in your dreams.

389
00:18:22,780 --> 00:18:25,720
I think it brings the room together.

390
00:18:27,870 --> 00:18:30,000
Hey, tomorrow who wants to paint the nursery?

391
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:30,990
I'll do it.

392
00:18:30,990 --> 00:18:32,040
Why do you get to do it?

393
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:32,950
I'm the artist.

394
00:18:32,950 --> 00:18:34,100
Just because you're starving

395
00:18:34,100 --> 00:18:36,240
doesn't make you an artist.

396
00:18:36,830 --> 00:18:39,610
Just because I look sickly doesn't mean I'm starving.

397
00:18:40,610 --> 00:18:42,480
Howard!

398
00:18:43,150 --> 00:18:45,780
Guys, you heard her, go see what she wants.

399
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:48,920
I think I'm in labor.

400
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:50,130
Oh, oh, okay.

401
00:18:50,130 --> 00:18:52,800
Okay, uh, uh, uh, I can do this.

402
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:53,930
We have a plan.

403
00:18:53,930 --> 00:18:56,160
Somebody please tell me the plan.

404
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:58,320
- I'll get the hospital bag. - I'll pull the van up.

405
00:18:58,320 --> 00:18:59,370
Meet you outside in 2 minutes.

406
00:18:59,370 --> 00:19:00,930
Team Baby, go!

407
00:19:03,940 --> 00:19:05,110
I love you.

408
00:19:05,110 --> 00:19:07,080
I love you, too.

409
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,500
Are we hugging or having a baby?

410
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:10,930
Let's go!
