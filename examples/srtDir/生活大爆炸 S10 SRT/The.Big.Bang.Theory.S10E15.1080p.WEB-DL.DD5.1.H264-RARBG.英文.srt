1
00:00:03,610 --> 00:00:07,110
Okay, I'm zeroing out the electro-osmotic flow rate

2
00:00:07,110 --> 00:00:09,560
in the micro-fluidic channel.

3
00:00:09,560 --> 00:00:11,340
Nicely done, Howard.

4
00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:14,010
Well, my wife is four-foot-ten and sexually satisfied,

5
00:00:14,010 --> 00:00:17,010
so clearly I know my way around tiny things.

6
00:00:17,310 --> 00:00:19,940
Good for you, on the cutting edge of new technology

7
00:00:19,940 --> 00:00:21,720
and still making inappropriate comments

8
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:24,550
about the mother of your child.

9
00:00:24,550 --> 00:00:27,760
Those are just the things I say out loud.

10
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:30,110
Gentlemen, we need to stop immediately.

11
00:00:30,110 --> 00:00:30,980
What's wrong?

12
00:00:30,980 --> 00:00:32,270
I'm looking at the math,

13
00:00:32,270 --> 00:00:34,280
and I think we can make the device

14
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:37,100
between eight and ten percent smaller.

15
00:00:37,100 --> 00:00:39,870
That's great, but the Air Force approved the specs.

16
00:00:39,870 --> 00:00:40,790
We're good to go.

17
00:00:40,790 --> 00:00:43,100
Yeah. It doesn't need to be smaller.

18
00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:45,330
Shame on you.

19
00:00:45,330 --> 00:00:49,450
Where would we be if poodle breeders had that attitude?

20
00:00:49,450 --> 00:00:50,240
I'll tell you.

21
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:52,010
We would have the standard and the miniature poodle,

22
00:00:52,010 --> 00:00:54,440
but no toy or teacup.

23
00:00:54,440 --> 00:00:55,200
Which by the way,

24
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:56,900
is not an officially recognized breed,

25
00:00:56,900 --> 00:00:59,520
but that's just poodle politics.

26
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:02,010
Can we please stop talking about poodles?

27
00:01:02,010 --> 00:01:04,280
Fine. Candy bars.

28
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:07,580
Now, do you enjoy a fun size? I know you do.

29
00:01:07,580 --> 00:01:09,570
Sheldon, we don't need to make this smaller.

30
00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:11,460
Your work is done. Go home.

31
00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:12,910
I don't want to go home.

32
00:01:12,910 --> 00:01:14,790
Fine, go for a little walk.

33
00:01:14,790 --> 00:01:15,780
Then what?

34
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:18,350
Just keep walking.

35
00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:47,860
At least it's quiet when he takes bathroom breaks.

36
00:01:48,290 --> 00:01:49,440
I know.

37
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:53,540
That's why I keep refilling his water when he's not looking.

38
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:55,260
You're kidding.

39
00:01:55,260 --> 00:01:58,670
I don't care if we're in a drought, it's worth it.

40
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:04,190
You know, I-I do have a way to get him out of our hair.

41
00:02:04,190 --> 00:02:05,750
I've been holding onto this for a few years,

42
00:02:05,750 --> 00:02:08,150
but maybe now's the time.

43
00:02:08,150 --> 00:02:11,710
W-We can just lock the door; you don't have to kill him.

44
00:02:12,270 --> 00:02:13,260
You can't kill him;

45
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:16,660
he'll just respawn at the last save point.

46
00:02:17,110 --> 00:02:20,730
Oh, that was my sixth trip to the bathroom.

47
00:02:20,730 --> 00:02:22,970
As long as that's not a urinary tract infection,

48
00:02:22,970 --> 00:02:25,390
that's a personal best.

49
00:02:25,390 --> 00:02:28,530
Hey, uh, buddy, I got you a little present.

50
00:02:28,530 --> 00:02:29,450
- Really? - Yeah.

51
00:02:29,450 --> 00:02:31,180
Go ahead, open it.

52
00:02:34,010 --> 00:02:35,690
"Congratulations.

53
00:02:35,690 --> 00:02:38,560
The bearer of this certificate is entitled

54
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:42,100
to the ultimate train experience

55
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:44,820
at The Nevada Northern Railway.

56
00:02:44,820 --> 00:02:47,100
You are at the throttle.

57
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:49,300
You are the engineer.

58
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:52,920
You are running the locomotive."

59
00:02:55,690 --> 00:02:57,900
This doesn't happen very often,

60
00:02:57,900 --> 00:03:00,060
but here comes a hug.

61
00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:06,430
Oh, dear! I have to tinkle again!

62
00:03:10,850 --> 00:03:13,260
Okay. Where were we?

63
00:03:15,530 --> 00:03:16,830
For Howie's occupation,

64
00:03:16,830 --> 00:03:18,810
should I include that he was an astronaut?

65
00:03:18,810 --> 00:03:22,860
Well, he mentioned it in his mother's eulogy, so why not?

66
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:24,250
I can't believe you have to fill out

67
00:03:24,250 --> 00:03:25,910
a preschool application for an infant.

68
00:03:25,910 --> 00:03:28,570
Uh, the one at Caltech has a crazy wait list.

69
00:03:28,570 --> 00:03:31,340
I warned you, a lot of people apply when they're still pregnant.

70
00:03:31,340 --> 00:03:32,490
Well, I didn't.

71
00:03:32,490 --> 00:03:36,620
I also skipped a birthing class to see Zootopia, so back off.

72
00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:38,160
Whoa. Just trying to help.

73
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:39,740
Sorry. Howie's back at work

74
00:03:39,740 --> 00:03:41,610
and there's just so much going on.

75
00:03:41,610 --> 00:03:43,210
Is there anything we can do?

76
00:03:43,210 --> 00:03:45,310
Sure. Open up a college fund,

77
00:03:45,310 --> 00:03:47,130
shop for life insurance, and in the laundry room,

78
00:03:47,130 --> 00:03:49,090
there's a mountain of dirty laundry.

79
00:03:49,090 --> 00:03:52,140
Wash it or burn in, your choice.

80
00:03:54,020 --> 00:03:55,010
Ugh, be right back.

81
00:03:55,010 --> 00:03:57,460
No, no. I will take care of it.

82
00:03:57,460 --> 00:03:58,120
Oh, thank you.

83
00:03:58,120 --> 00:03:59,230
While I'm gone, you can think about

84
00:03:59,230 --> 00:04:01,440
how mean you were to me.

85
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:03,480
All right, you know what you need?

86
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:05,100
A night away from all of this.

87
00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:07,560
You know, where you can just kind of relax and...

88
00:04:08,410 --> 00:04:12,060
I'm just gonna... turn this off.

89
00:04:16,290 --> 00:04:18,050
Much better.

90
00:04:18,510 --> 00:04:19,630
Seriously, let's plan a night,

91
00:04:19,630 --> 00:04:20,530
you know, give you a break.

92
00:04:20,530 --> 00:04:22,180
We could go dancing.

93
00:04:22,180 --> 00:04:23,740
That sounds really nice.

94
00:04:24,390 --> 00:04:27,320
All this week, the Early Music Society of Pasadena

95
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:31,540
is doing a joint concert with the San Gabriel Renaissance Choir.

96
00:04:32,420 --> 00:04:35,280
Okay, that's the one to beat.

97
00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:36,420
Good luck.

98
00:04:36,420 --> 00:04:39,960
People have been saying that for 600 years.

99
00:04:43,830 --> 00:04:45,920
Hey, you're home early.

100
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:47,130
You'll never believe it.

101
00:04:47,130 --> 00:04:49,210
Leonard gave me the most incredible gift,

102
00:04:49,210 --> 00:04:51,690
a trip to a historic railway,

103
00:04:51,690 --> 00:04:55,190
and I get to operate an actual locomotive.

104
00:04:55,190 --> 00:04:57,480
Wow. He finally used it.

105
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:59,310
What'd you do?

106
00:05:00,230 --> 00:05:01,290
No idea.

107
00:05:01,290 --> 00:05:03,780
All I know is I'm gonna be working on the railroad

108
00:05:03,780 --> 00:05:06,070
all the livelong day.

109
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:08,110
Well, I'm really happy for you.

110
00:05:08,110 --> 00:05:09,760
Oh, no. It's not just me. No.

111
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:12,310
The railway is four hours from the nearest airport,

112
00:05:12,310 --> 00:05:14,390
and guess who gets to drive me.

113
00:05:14,390 --> 00:05:15,470
I give up.

114
00:05:15,470 --> 00:05:16,270
You!

115
00:05:16,270 --> 00:05:18,960
No. I really give up.

116
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:21,110
Oh, oh. And guess where we get to sleep?

117
00:05:21,110 --> 00:05:24,430
Our choice of a turn-of-the-century railway bunkhouse

118
00:05:24,430 --> 00:05:25,940
or a working caboose.

119
00:05:25,940 --> 00:05:28,640
Now, the problem with a caboose is there's no bathroom,

120
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:32,440
but the problem with the bunkhouse is it's not a caboose.

121
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:34,390
On the first day,

122
00:05:34,390 --> 00:05:36,960
I get to drive a steam engine.

123
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:39,380
Oh, and the second day, a diesel engine.

124
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:40,450
Oh, and

125
00:05:40,450 --> 00:05:43,070
if I volunteer to do track maintenance and paperwork,

126
00:05:43,070 --> 00:05:45,840
they'll let me stay as long as I want.

127
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:49,390
So you might want to pack enough clothes for the rest of our lives.

128
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:52,710
Can I pee now?

129
00:05:53,290 --> 00:05:56,190
Oh, get this!

130
00:05:56,190 --> 00:06:00,750
I get to take a test based on a 125-page manual.

131
00:06:00,750 --> 00:06:02,900
I get to learn things like hand signals.

132
00:06:03,250 --> 00:06:06,760
There's forward, uh, reverse,

133
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:08,720
set the brakes.

134
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:09,620
Are you done yet?

135
00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:12,680
You're missing some great stuff out here.

136
00:06:13,060 --> 00:06:15,480
Oh, this is good.

137
00:06:16,390 --> 00:06:18,480
There are dozens of railroad crossings

138
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:20,500
you have to blow the whistle for.

139
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:22,990
But that is the figurative you, not the literal you.

140
00:06:22,990 --> 00:06:25,100
I'll be blowing the whistle.

141
00:06:26,150 --> 00:06:28,730
Amy, get up. It's time to go to work.

142
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:33,930
This train thing worked out better than I thought.

143
00:06:33,930 --> 00:06:36,510
He's home studying the engineer's manual.

144
00:06:38,020 --> 00:06:40,360
It's so peaceful without him here.

145
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:42,000
Can I ask you how much that cost?

146
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,720
$4,000-- worth every penny.

147
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:46,850
Gentlemen.

148
00:06:46,850 --> 00:06:48,030
- Colonel Williams. - Sir.

149
00:06:48,030 --> 00:06:50,340
Just wanted to see how the guidance system's coming along.

150
00:06:50,340 --> 00:06:51,910
Great. We found a cooling solution

151
00:06:51,910 --> 00:06:53,640
that allowed us to get the size of the prototype

152
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:55,350
down to the target specs.

153
00:06:55,350 --> 00:06:59,150
As a cooling solution, it's pretty cool.

154
00:07:00,190 --> 00:07:01,660
Don't do that.

155
00:07:03,990 --> 00:07:05,240
What's this?

156
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:07,180
Oh, nothing. Just some math we don't need.

157
00:07:07,180 --> 00:07:08,500
This is a different approach.

158
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:11,330
Are you trying to get the guidance system even smaller?

159
00:07:11,330 --> 00:07:13,420
It's just a theory.

160
00:07:13,420 --> 00:07:15,310
Uh, it's not even worked out.

161
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:19,480
I want this.

162
00:07:20,270 --> 00:07:23,040
But we've already met the agreed upon specs.

163
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:27,180
Going smaller would require weeks' worth of new computations.

164
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:30,040
So get the kid with the two shirts to do it.

165
00:07:31,510 --> 00:07:34,700
Sir, uh, I-if I may, uh, we've put a lot

166
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:37,530
of thought and effort into this current prototype.

167
00:07:37,530 --> 00:07:39,330
It's a really elegant solution,

168
00:07:39,330 --> 00:07:42,080
and most importantly, it works.

169
00:07:42,340 --> 00:07:44,530
Yeah, I want this.

170
00:07:45,390 --> 00:07:46,570
But that's just a theory.

171
00:07:46,570 --> 00:07:48,460
It's not even a complete thought.

172
00:07:48,460 --> 00:07:50,160
You both make excellent points.

173
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:52,710
And thank you for presenting it so articulately.

174
00:07:53,350 --> 00:07:54,800
Make this.

175
00:07:59,140 --> 00:08:02,410
The kid with the two shirts screwed us again.

176
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:07,180
All right. You guys ready to get crazy?

177
00:08:07,180 --> 00:08:10,760
Well, the bra under here ain't beige.

178
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:12,090
Okay.

179
00:08:12,090 --> 00:08:13,940
You ladies have fun tonight.

180
00:08:13,940 --> 00:08:16,360
Don't worry about Halley. Uncle Stuart's on the job.

181
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:19,520
Under the careful supervision of her godfather.

182
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:23,970
My apologies. I didn't mean to offend you, Don Corleone.

183
00:08:24,230 --> 00:08:25,810
Like I said, you ladies have fun.

184
00:08:25,810 --> 00:08:28,070
We will. Got my dancing shoes, got my breast pump.

185
00:08:28,070 --> 00:08:29,900
Let's party.

186
00:08:30,530 --> 00:08:31,370
You know, if you pump at the bar,

187
00:08:31,370 --> 00:08:33,600
I promise we'll get free drinks.

188
00:08:34,310 --> 00:08:35,420
Call if there's any problems.

189
00:08:35,420 --> 00:08:37,020
No. She's busy. You call Howard.

190
00:08:37,020 --> 00:08:38,450
Got it.

191
00:08:38,450 --> 00:08:40,620
Call me. Don't call Howard.

192
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:43,430
I would never call Howard.

193
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:46,810
Okay, instead of arguing all night,

194
00:08:46,810 --> 00:08:48,830
let's just split up the baby chores.

195
00:08:48,830 --> 00:08:51,180
Yeah, great. Um, I'll put food in her top half,

196
00:08:51,180 --> 00:08:53,790
you deal with whatever comes out the bottom.

197
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:59,110
I can't believe we have to ask Sheldon

198
00:08:59,110 --> 00:09:00,670
to come back and help us.

199
00:09:00,670 --> 00:09:01,590
Oh, boo-hoo.

200
00:09:01,590 --> 00:09:02,840
I spent four grand on a gift

201
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:05,760
that only got rid of him for an afternoon.

202
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:14,510
What is that?

203
00:09:14,510 --> 00:09:15,710
I don't know, but if he yells,

204
00:09:15,710 --> 00:09:17,920
"It's alive," we run.

205
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:28,350
If you knocked, I couldn't hear you.

206
00:09:28,350 --> 00:09:30,980
I'm welding this locomotive engine.

207
00:09:32,290 --> 00:09:35,580
And if you didn't knock, how about some manners?

208
00:09:36,870 --> 00:09:39,020
How'd you even get that up the stairs?

209
00:09:39,020 --> 00:09:42,810
I said to myself, "I think I can, I think I can."

210
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:46,400
And then I couldn't, so...

211
00:09:46,780 --> 00:09:50,300
I paid two men who promised not to come rob us later.

212
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:52,520
Okay, look, Sheldon, the Colonel wants us

213
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:54,510
to make the guidance system smaller,

214
00:09:54,510 --> 00:09:56,550
and we can't do it without you.

215
00:09:56,550 --> 00:09:58,430
Interesting.

216
00:09:58,430 --> 00:09:59,920
Well, so I was right.

217
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:03,570
Open a window. It's about to get smug in here.

218
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:05,700
Well, I would love to help you,

219
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:08,040
but since I discovered the satisfaction

220
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:10,620
of working with my hands on a train engine,

221
00:10:10,620 --> 00:10:13,240
I don't think I can go back to theory.

222
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:15,350
I'm an engineer now.

223
00:10:16,580 --> 00:10:18,640
And, hey, just to be clear,

224
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:21,070
a train engineer.

225
00:10:21,550 --> 00:10:23,980
Not that goofy kind you are.

226
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:32,350
Sheldon, you can still go on the trip in a few weeks.

227
00:10:32,350 --> 00:10:33,400
Just help us out.

228
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:35,250
Sorry. I need to work on this engine

229
00:10:35,250 --> 00:10:39,030
so when I get to the train yard I won't look foolish.

230
00:10:39,910 --> 00:10:41,140
He's worried about looking foolish.

231
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:44,740
That's a Heapin' helpin' of irony right there.

232
00:10:45,450 --> 00:10:47,520
Come on, you know you're not leaving physics.

233
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:49,240
Why are you doing this?

234
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:52,810
Leonard, in the world of theoretical physics,

235
00:10:52,810 --> 00:10:55,840
you never finish; so much is unprovable.

236
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:57,970
But when I was studying that railway guide,

237
00:10:57,970 --> 00:11:01,450
it was so tangible and so satisfying

238
00:11:01,450 --> 00:11:03,250
that something just clicked.

239
00:11:03,350 --> 00:11:05,190
Then it clacked.

240
00:11:06,250 --> 00:11:07,550
Then it clicked, then it clacked,

241
00:11:07,550 --> 00:11:10,180
click-clack clickety-clack, and here we are.

242
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:18,060
Did you hear anything back from the Caltech preschool?

243
00:11:18,060 --> 00:11:20,320
Not yet, but we're gonna apply to a bunch of others

244
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:21,710
just to keep our options open.

245
00:11:21,710 --> 00:11:23,510
Okay, stop that! No more preschool talk.

246
00:11:23,510 --> 00:11:25,340
Tonight is about having fun.

247
00:11:25,780 --> 00:11:28,610
Nothing says fun like being scolded.

248
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:32,480
It's Raj.

249
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:33,900
Everything okay?

250
00:11:33,900 --> 00:11:37,410
Don't worry. Everything's fine.

251
00:11:37,630 --> 00:11:39,610
Hang up! We don't need help.

252
00:11:39,610 --> 00:11:43,530
I don't need your help deciding when we need help!

253
00:11:43,970 --> 00:11:45,560
Raj, what's going on?

254
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:46,690
Yes, so,

255
00:11:46,690 --> 00:11:49,390
I was just warming up some milk for Halley,

256
00:11:49,390 --> 00:11:51,450
and I-I thought it smelled a little funky,

257
00:11:51,450 --> 00:11:53,890
so I checked the date that you wrote on the bottle,

258
00:11:53,890 --> 00:11:56,550
and it says "Flerbsday."

259
00:11:56,550 --> 00:11:58,050
It says "Tuesday."

260
00:11:58,050 --> 00:12:00,600
How is that a "T"?!

261
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,050
I'm sure it's fine, but if you're worried,

262
00:12:04,050 --> 00:12:05,640
there's extra milk in the freezer.

263
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:06,690
Okay, yes,

264
00:12:06,690 --> 00:12:09,030
I will err on the side of caution

265
00:12:09,030 --> 00:12:11,260
and defrost a fresh batch.

266
00:12:11,260 --> 00:12:12,850
You're wasting perfectly good milk.

267
00:12:12,850 --> 00:12:15,130
- Fine, you drink it. - It's just milk.

268
00:12:15,130 --> 00:12:17,690
Stuart, don't you drink my milk!

269
00:12:18,730 --> 00:12:20,130
Okay, give-

270
00:12:20,130 --> 00:12:21,860
Can you guys handle this or not?

271
00:12:21,860 --> 00:12:23,380
Oh, of course we can.

272
00:12:23,380 --> 00:12:26,030
Uh, you girls have a good time.

273
00:12:26,630 --> 00:12:29,120
She said I was in charge.

274
00:12:32,860 --> 00:12:34,220
So we just throw this away?

275
00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:34,990
What else are you gonna do with it?

276
00:12:34,990 --> 00:12:36,320
Put it in your coffee?

277
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:38,870
Well, I don't take it black.

278
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:44,910
Okay. This is everything he had on the board.

279
00:12:44,910 --> 00:12:46,570
I'm sure we can figure the rest out.

280
00:12:46,570 --> 00:12:47,740
All right.

281
00:12:52,940 --> 00:12:53,950
Feel free to jump in.

282
00:12:53,950 --> 00:12:55,760
"Hmm" is all I got.

283
00:12:56,660 --> 00:12:58,890
Oh, we can get this.

284
00:13:00,770 --> 00:13:03,660
Is there any chance it's upside-down?

285
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:07,630
Maybe we can find another theoretical physicist to help us.

286
00:13:07,630 --> 00:13:08,830
It's classified.

287
00:13:08,830 --> 00:13:10,510
If we tell anyone, we'd get in trouble.

288
00:13:10,510 --> 00:13:11,890
Hey, I came up with that and "Hmm."

289
00:13:11,890 --> 00:13:13,970
You haven't pitched anything.

290
00:13:14,130 --> 00:13:16,190
Just keep thinking.

291
00:13:18,750 --> 00:13:20,370
I got it.

292
00:13:24,020 --> 00:13:25,640
You really figured it out?

293
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:26,960
No,

294
00:13:27,380 --> 00:13:29,590
but when we show this nonsense to Sheldon,

295
00:13:29,590 --> 00:13:33,910
it will make him crazy, and he'll have to fix it.

296
00:13:34,610 --> 00:13:35,660
Oh, you're a genius.

297
00:13:35,660 --> 00:13:36,820
Yeah, I know.

298
00:13:36,820 --> 00:13:38,350
That's not even a math symbol.

299
00:13:38,350 --> 00:13:41,040
That's just Charlie Brown's hair.

300
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:45,270
Sorry, guys.

301
00:13:45,270 --> 00:13:46,820
This club was so great.

302
00:13:46,820 --> 00:13:48,760
How could they turn it into a bookstore?

303
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:51,320
I thought we got rid of all those.

304
00:13:52,220 --> 00:13:55,740
Renaissance Choir's looking pretty good right now, huh?

305
00:13:58,110 --> 00:13:59,140
Hello?

306
00:13:59,140 --> 00:14:01,570
Nothing to worry about.

307
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:04,090
She's just been crying for a little while,

308
00:14:04,090 --> 00:14:06,910
and I was wondering if you had any tricks to get her to sleep.

309
00:14:06,910 --> 00:14:10,650
She was sleeping just fine till you took a selfie with her!

310
00:14:10,860 --> 00:14:12,130
She was blowing a spit bubble.

311
00:14:12,130 --> 00:14:14,380
It was adorable!

312
00:14:15,700 --> 00:14:18,100
You guys got this? Do you need me to come home?

313
00:14:18,980 --> 00:14:20,020
Wait.

314
00:14:20,020 --> 00:14:21,300
She's settling down.

315
00:14:21,300 --> 00:14:23,170
Oh, okay, false alarm.

316
00:14:23,460 --> 00:14:24,590
Little parenting tip:

317
00:14:24,590 --> 00:14:27,360
sleeping babies hate flash photography.

318
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:30,420
Is everything okay?

319
00:14:30,420 --> 00:14:31,340
Yeah.

320
00:14:31,340 --> 00:14:33,000
I may have just left my infant daughter

321
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:36,110
with Patrick and SpongeBob.

322
00:14:37,100 --> 00:14:39,220
Hey, there's another dance club nearby.

323
00:14:39,220 --> 00:14:41,780
I mean, I don't know how you feel about Latin music,

324
00:14:41,780 --> 00:14:46,140
but according to their horas of operacion, they're open.

325
00:14:46,810 --> 00:14:48,420
Maybe we should just call it a night.

326
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:51,270
You sure? They're open till dos.

327
00:14:52,010 --> 00:14:53,040
Yeah, we're all dressed up.

328
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:54,090
Why go home?

329
00:14:54,090 --> 00:14:56,250
I'm just not really in the mood anymore.

330
00:14:56,250 --> 00:14:57,650
What's going on with you?

331
00:14:57,650 --> 00:14:59,310
I don't know. This is all starting to feel

332
00:14:59,310 --> 00:15:01,800
like a sad attempt to recapture our youth.

333
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:03,010
I'm not sad.

334
00:15:03,010 --> 00:15:06,340
I just wanted to get drunk and not wear sweatpants.

335
00:15:07,190 --> 00:15:08,150
I'm not sad.

336
00:15:08,150 --> 00:15:10,240
I mean, hello.

337
00:15:12,660 --> 00:15:14,430
Okay, maybe I'm the one who's sad.

338
00:15:14,430 --> 00:15:16,570
What are you sad about?

339
00:15:16,570 --> 00:15:19,370
Maybe the fact that you went and had a baby.

340
00:15:19,370 --> 00:15:20,680
You're upset I had a baby?

341
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:22,610
No, of course not. I just...

342
00:15:22,610 --> 00:15:25,280
I didn't think it would make me have all these feelings.

343
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:26,420
What feelings?

344
00:15:26,420 --> 00:15:27,850
Pressure!

345
00:15:27,850 --> 00:15:28,930
I mean, she's looking at preschools,

346
00:15:28,930 --> 00:15:31,310
she has a minivan, she has a 401k.

347
00:15:31,310 --> 00:15:34,890
Before she talked about it, I just thought that was a race.

348
00:15:34,890 --> 00:15:36,840
You think that stuff is fun?

349
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:38,920
Being a parent is terrifying.

350
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:41,560
I'm constantly worried, I'm always tired,

351
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:43,460
and in a few minutes, I'm gonna milk myself

352
00:15:43,460 --> 00:15:46,320
in a bookstore parking lot.

353
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:48,060
I get that, okay?

354
00:15:48,060 --> 00:15:49,990
It's just, Leonard and I have been married for two years,

355
00:15:49,990 --> 00:15:52,400
and we're no further along than when we were dating.

356
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:52,960
Come on.

357
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:54,570
You've got so much to feel good about.

358
00:15:54,570 --> 00:15:56,550
You've got a great job now.

359
00:15:56,550 --> 00:15:58,910
Yeah, I guess I am making decent money.

360
00:15:58,910 --> 00:16:00,670
You make more than I do.

361
00:16:00,670 --> 00:16:03,560
You may not have a house yet, but your apartment's great.

362
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:05,320
It's bigger than mine.

363
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:07,930
And Leonard loves you so much, he married you twice.

364
00:16:07,930 --> 00:16:10,470
I'm not even engaged once.

365
00:16:10,570 --> 00:16:13,410
I don't even know if Sheldon thinks about marriage.

366
00:16:13,410 --> 00:16:15,250
I'm not getting any younger.

367
00:16:15,250 --> 00:16:17,060
Honestly, I kind of thought by now,

368
00:16:17,060 --> 00:16:18,320
we might have had some sort of...

369
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:21,900
Careful. The sound of crying can make me lactate.

370
00:16:22,380 --> 00:16:24,470
I'm sorry. I can't help it.

371
00:16:24,470 --> 00:16:28,260
Oh, that's gonna make me cry.

372
00:16:29,150 --> 00:16:31,590
And there they go.

373
00:16:38,930 --> 00:16:42,060
Well, Sheldon, turns out we didn't need you after all.

374
00:16:42,060 --> 00:16:46,000
That's right. We figured it out all by ourselves.

375
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,220
Wasn't even that hard.

376
00:16:48,220 --> 00:16:49,890
Well, good for you guys.

377
00:16:49,890 --> 00:16:53,730
Look, I have a grease smudge on my hand, and I'm okay with it.

378
00:16:54,710 --> 00:16:57,310
Aren't you gonna look at the board to see how right we are?

379
00:16:57,310 --> 00:17:00,120
No, thanks. I'm busy trying to fix this fuel pump.

380
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:01,860
It's a manifold.

381
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:05,350
Well, I guess it's fixed.

382
00:17:06,340 --> 00:17:08,340
Just look at the board.

383
00:17:08,340 --> 00:17:09,710
That's wrong.

384
00:17:09,710 --> 00:17:12,250
Oh, no!

385
00:17:14,270 --> 00:17:17,430
What should we have done differently?

386
00:17:17,430 --> 00:17:19,910
Well, first of all, you can't use relativistic

387
00:17:19,910 --> 00:17:22,870
and non-relativistic vectors in the same equation.

388
00:17:22,870 --> 00:17:24,350
Told ya.

389
00:17:25,900 --> 00:17:27,910
Can you fix it for us?

390
00:17:28,690 --> 00:17:31,610
Okay, but this is the last time.

391
00:17:47,490 --> 00:17:50,100
Nice try, blockheads.

392
00:17:51,850 --> 00:17:54,410
Come on, Sheldon. You can't turn your back on physics.

393
00:17:54,410 --> 00:17:56,530
Besides, you have no idea what you're doing with this stuff.

394
00:17:56,530 --> 00:17:58,500
But if you really want to learn the mechanical side,

395
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:00,010
I can teach you anything you want to know.

396
00:18:00,010 --> 00:18:02,030
And instead of standing around watching,

397
00:18:02,030 --> 00:18:04,440
you can help us build your smaller guidance system.

398
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:05,880
And with all these new skills,

399
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:07,360
you'd be able to fix any model train.

400
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:09,990
You'd be the king of the train store!

401
00:18:10,490 --> 00:18:11,880
Excuse me. I have a girlfriend.

402
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:14,590
I'm already king of the train store.

403
00:18:16,550 --> 00:18:18,440
So, what do you say?

404
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:20,650
Oh, what choice do I have? You need me.

405
00:18:20,650 --> 00:18:23,100
I'm like the crankshaft of this team.

406
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:25,310
That's a turbo.

407
00:18:26,070 --> 00:18:27,380
Well, whatever it is, it looks heavy.

408
00:18:27,380 --> 00:18:30,460
I'm gonna need you two to get it downstairs before Amy comes home.

409
00:18:47,970 --> 00:18:51,130
I apologize that it's so warm in here.

410
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:53,560
It is warm in here.

411
00:18:59,740 --> 00:19:02,140
I've worked up a bit of a sweat.

412
00:19:03,140 --> 00:19:04,730
Me, too.

413
00:19:07,970 --> 00:19:10,360
May I borrow your water?

414
00:19:18,490 --> 00:19:19,610
* Here I am *

415
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:24,120
{\an8}Rock you like a hurricane - Scorpians

416
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:24,120
* Rock you like a hurricane *

417
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:27,650
* Here I am *

418
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:31,830
* Rock you like a hurricane *

419
00:19:33,660 --> 00:19:35,230
The light's green.

420
00:19:38,950 --> 00:19:40,160
Sorry.

421
00:19:40,550 --> 00:19:43,490
GPS says we'll be at the railway in three hours.

422
00:19:43,490 --> 00:19:45,830
I can get us there in two.

423
00:01:11,180 --> 00:01:15,800
{\an8}V

424
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,960
