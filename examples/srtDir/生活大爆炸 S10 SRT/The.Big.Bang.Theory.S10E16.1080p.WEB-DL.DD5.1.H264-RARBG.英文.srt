1
00:00:04,010 --> 00:00:04,910
Go!

2
00:00:05,570 --> 00:00:06,440
Come on, Raj!

3
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:07,100
You can do this!

4
00:00:07,100 --> 00:00:08,140
There's no way.

5
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:09,080
What is happening?

6
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:10,330
This is an Euler's Disk.

7
00:00:10,330 --> 00:00:11,120
It's a physics toy

8
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:12,940
that demonstrates angular momentum,

9
00:00:12,940 --> 00:00:14,950
potential energy, and kinetic energy.

10
00:00:14,950 --> 00:00:18,090
Aw, look at you watching sports.

11
00:00:18,090 --> 00:00:19,520
We're betting to see if Koothrappali

12
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:21,700
can hold his breath longer than the disk can spin.

13
00:00:21,700 --> 00:00:23,180
Its weight and smoothness,

14
00:00:23,180 --> 00:00:24,950
along with the slight concavity of the mirror,

15
00:00:24,950 --> 00:00:26,600
means it can spin for a long time.

16
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:28,070
But Raj is from India,

17
00:00:28,070 --> 00:00:31,270
which means he's no slouch at holding his breath.

18
00:00:32,020 --> 00:00:33,340
Okay, I want in. Ten bucks says

19
00:00:33,340 --> 00:00:36,720
I'll lose interest before that thing stops spinning.

20
00:00:37,790 --> 00:00:39,830
Hey, Sheldon, I found a great restaurant for date night.

21
00:00:39,830 --> 00:00:41,630
Kind of busy right now.

22
00:00:41,630 --> 00:00:43,500
Oh, an Euler's Disk! Fun!

23
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:45,890
Yeah, we're seeing if Raj can hold his breath longer than it.

24
00:00:45,890 --> 00:00:48,200
Oh. Immature.

25
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:50,190
How ya doing?

26
00:00:50,890 --> 00:00:52,300
He's not gonna make it.

27
00:00:52,300 --> 00:00:53,780
- Yes, he is! - You know,

28
00:00:53,780 --> 00:00:56,570
deep-sea divers holding their breath for several minutes

29
00:00:56,570 --> 00:00:58,850
have shown elevated markers of a protein

30
00:00:58,850 --> 00:01:00,520
that can signal brain damage.

31
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:04,520
Yeah, see, what's happening here signals brain damage.

32
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:07,010
My God, how long does this thing spin for?

33
00:01:07,010 --> 00:01:09,880
Ha! You're interested! You're out ten bucks!

34
00:01:10,220 --> 00:01:12,280
- It's slowing down! - Dig deep!

35
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:15,490
Like when we bet you couldn't fit into Howard's pants!

36
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:18,300
He's not gonna make it!

37
00:01:18,300 --> 00:01:19,290
Yes, he is!

38
00:01:19,290 --> 00:01:21,170
Come on, Raj! It's like your favorite movie!

39
00:01:21,170 --> 00:01:24,570
You're just Waiting to Exhale!

40
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:31,240
Yeah! I knew you could do it!

41
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:34,150
And j.. and just so you know,

42
00:01:34,150 --> 00:01:35,750
my favorite movie...

43
00:01:36,100 --> 00:01:38,400
is Princess Bride.

44
00:02:07,420 --> 00:02:09,840
Hello, Rajesh. How are things by you?

45
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:11,230
Good, good.

46
00:02:11,230 --> 00:02:13,170
Uh, listen, I just wanted to let you know

47
00:02:13,170 --> 00:02:14,520
when you get my credit card bill,

48
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:16,310
it might be a little high this month.

49
00:02:16,310 --> 00:02:18,710
Well, you're a grown man with a steady job.

50
00:02:18,710 --> 00:02:22,410
Why wouldn't you spend all your father's money?

51
00:02:23,110 --> 00:02:26,640
Oh, Daddy, you're so rich and funny.

52
00:02:27,260 --> 00:02:29,960
Yeah. So what else is going on with your life?

53
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:33,030
Uh, well, I was dating a woman at the university,

54
00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:34,340
but we broke up.

55
00:02:34,340 --> 00:02:35,860
I'm sorry to hear that.

56
00:02:35,860 --> 00:02:39,880
I know you are. That's why you just bought me a new iPad.

57
00:02:40,750 --> 00:02:41,980
And before you start,

58
00:02:41,980 --> 00:02:45,120
I am not interested in you arranging a marriage for me.

59
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:47,670
Oh, I gave up on that a long time ago.

60
00:02:47,670 --> 00:02:48,750
You did?

61
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:50,050
It's too much work.

62
00:02:50,050 --> 00:02:51,220
You're an adult who can't get by

63
00:02:51,220 --> 00:02:53,580
without an allowance from his parents.

64
00:02:53,580 --> 00:02:55,450
Women don't want that.

65
00:02:55,450 --> 00:02:58,530
Wh-What are you saying, that y-you're giving up on me?

66
00:02:58,530 --> 00:03:00,500
What kind of father gives up on his son?

67
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:01,940
I have six children,

68
00:03:01,940 --> 00:03:04,380
five of whom are married and self-sufficient.

69
00:03:04,380 --> 00:03:07,550
I don't think I'm the problem.

70
00:03:08,660 --> 00:03:10,130
I can't believe what I'm hearing.

71
00:03:10,130 --> 00:03:12,210
This is deeply hurtful.

72
00:03:12,210 --> 00:03:13,640
You're also too sensitive.

73
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:16,670
Women don't want that either.

74
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:21,710
The food here's supposed to be great.

75
00:03:21,710 --> 00:03:23,060
Don't fill up on chips.

76
00:03:23,060 --> 00:03:24,780
Oh, I won't. I have a trick.

77
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:27,920
I only eat equilateral triangles.

78
00:03:28,310 --> 00:03:31,430
Isosceles, isosceles,

79
00:03:31,430 --> 00:03:33,820
oh, scalene...

80
00:03:35,540 --> 00:03:36,980
You didn't see that.

81
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:41,230
Oh, look. It's Bert, at the bar.

82
00:03:41,230 --> 00:03:42,900
We should go say hi.

83
00:03:43,670 --> 00:03:45,270
Why?

84
00:03:45,790 --> 00:03:47,210
Because that's what you do

85
00:03:47,210 --> 00:03:50,350
when you see someone you know in a public place.

86
00:03:50,350 --> 00:03:54,200
I have multiple restraining orders that say otherwise.

87
00:03:56,100 --> 00:03:58,600
Sheldon, there's a difference between greeting a friend

88
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:01,320
and following a celebrity into a bathroom.

89
00:04:02,530 --> 00:04:03,730
If the judge couldn't explain it to me,

90
00:04:03,730 --> 00:04:05,850
I don't see how you will.

91
00:04:08,570 --> 00:04:10,080
- Hi, Bert. - Hello.

92
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:11,250
Oh, hey, guys.

93
00:04:11,250 --> 00:04:12,390
What brings you here?

94
00:04:12,390 --> 00:04:14,250
- Oh, we're having date night. - Nice.

95
00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:15,640
I'm meeting someone, too.

96
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:17,640
Oh, really. Anybody we know?

97
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:20,590
I doubt it. I met her on G-Harmony.

98
00:04:20,590 --> 00:04:24,460
That's a Web site for geologists to find love.

99
00:04:24,460 --> 00:04:25,900
That's a real thing?

100
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:28,960
Yeah. Their slogan is "we're all about dating

101
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:32,730
and not the carbon-14 kind."

102
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:35,460
Well, have a lovely evening.

103
00:04:35,460 --> 00:04:37,690
Thanks. You, too.

104
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:40,730
If you think that's more fun than talking to Zachary Quinto

105
00:04:40,730 --> 00:04:43,670
through a stall door, you're crazy.

106
00:04:45,420 --> 00:04:46,740
You know, we could've come to you guys.

107
00:04:46,740 --> 00:04:48,060
You didn't have to bring the baby here.

108
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:49,920
Oh, it's okay. It's good to get out of the house.

109
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:51,410
And the car ride puts her to sleep.

110
00:04:51,410 --> 00:04:54,900
Aw, that used to work with Sheldon.

111
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:57,350
Yeah, until someone left him in the drugstore parking lot

112
00:04:57,350 --> 00:04:58,330
and he freaked out.

113
00:04:58,330 --> 00:05:00,920
Who forgot to crack the window?

114
00:05:01,490 --> 00:05:03,050
Hello!

115
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:05,310
Someone's been shopping at Gucci.

116
00:05:05,310 --> 00:05:08,460
Yeah, I saw something for Halley and I couldn't resist.

117
00:05:08,460 --> 00:05:09,460
That's so sweet of you.

118
00:05:09,460 --> 00:05:14,000
Yeah, it's a crushed velvet baby cape.

119
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:18,640
Oh, no, now we have two.

120
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:21,780
- That must've been expensive. - Yeah, it was.

121
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:25,160
But it's my father's money and I'm mad at him.

122
00:05:25,510 --> 00:05:26,520
What's going on with your dad?

123
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:27,750
And if you really want to hurt him,

124
00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:30,240
I look great in Chanel.

125
00:05:30,470 --> 00:05:33,360
It turns out he doesn't care if I'm married or if I'm single.

126
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:35,560
He's basically given up on me.

127
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:37,110
Oh, I'm sure that's not true.

128
00:05:37,110 --> 00:05:40,390
It is. He stopped trying to find Indian girls for me to marry.

129
00:05:40,390 --> 00:05:42,510
All you did was complain when he did that.

130
00:05:42,510 --> 00:05:45,960
Leonard, he's hurting. Let him feel how he feels.

131
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:47,140
- Thank you, Penny. - Yeah.

132
00:05:47,140 --> 00:05:50,270
Shoes, I'm a seven-and-a-half; boots, I'm an eight.

133
00:05:52,690 --> 00:05:54,880
...MSN Search,

134
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:56,620
AltaVista,

135
00:05:56,620 --> 00:05:59,930
and... Ask Jeeves.

136
00:05:59,930 --> 00:06:01,130
You?

137
00:06:01,460 --> 00:06:05,560
Sorry, I don't have a list of defunct search engines that I miss.

138
00:06:06,660 --> 00:06:08,880
Hey. Looks like I got stood up,

139
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:10,900
- so I'm gonna head out. - Oh, no.

140
00:06:10,900 --> 00:06:13,080
Are you sure you don't want to give her a few more minutes?

141
00:06:13,180 --> 00:06:16,280
Nah, G-Harmony recommends after two hours,

142
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:19,130
it's time to cut bait.

143
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:21,870
I'm so sorry.

144
00:06:21,870 --> 00:06:25,080
Bert, I insist that you join us.

145
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:26,460
You really wouldn't mind?

146
00:06:26,460 --> 00:06:28,100
Not at all. Amy?

147
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:29,330
Fine with me.

148
00:06:29,330 --> 00:06:32,180
Thanks. I'll go grab a chair.

149
00:06:32,650 --> 00:06:35,330
Sheldon, that was so sweet of you.

150
00:06:35,330 --> 00:06:37,290
Well, I could deduce by his facial expression

151
00:06:37,290 --> 00:06:40,210
and body language that he was sad.

152
00:06:40,210 --> 00:06:44,000
So the part where he got stood up didn't clue you in?

153
00:06:44,820 --> 00:06:48,300
You want me to look at him and listen to him?

154
00:06:49,870 --> 00:06:52,680
My father thinks the reason I can't make a relationship work

155
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:55,080
is because I'm spoiled.

156
00:07:00,060 --> 00:07:03,650
I'm sorry, is he waiting for someone to disagree?

157
00:07:03,650 --> 00:07:05,480
Just because he helps me out

158
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:07,740
doesn't automatically mean that I'm spoiled.

159
00:07:07,740 --> 00:07:10,300
All right, how much exactly does he pay for?

160
00:07:11,910 --> 00:07:13,210
Okay, I'll tell you,

161
00:07:13,210 --> 00:07:14,970
but please don't judge me.

162
00:07:14,970 --> 00:07:20,150
He pays for my car, my rent, and my credit cards.

163
00:07:21,460 --> 00:07:24,380
I'm trying, but I'm judging.

164
00:07:26,010 --> 00:07:27,130
Maybe your dad's right.

165
00:07:27,130 --> 00:07:29,380
Yeah, women do like a man that can support himself.

166
00:07:29,380 --> 00:07:31,290
But Bernadette makes more money than Howard.

167
00:07:31,290 --> 00:07:34,550
She basically supports him.

168
00:07:34,550 --> 00:07:37,200
Yeah, maybe your dad's right.

169
00:07:40,470 --> 00:07:43,090
Good question. Let's see.

170
00:07:43,090 --> 00:07:44,760
Infoseek,

171
00:07:45,070 --> 00:07:46,720
WebCrawler,

172
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:48,760
oh, HotBot.

173
00:07:49,110 --> 00:07:51,720
Okay, literally any other topic.

174
00:07:52,740 --> 00:07:55,320
All right. How did you guys meet?

175
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:57,290
Actually, we met online.

176
00:07:57,290 --> 00:07:59,440
Our-our first date was at a coffee shop.

177
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:02,900
Although, unlike your date, she actually showed up.

178
00:08:03,980 --> 00:08:05,970
Oh, he looks sad again.

179
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:10,050
Well, I really envy your relationship.

180
00:08:10,050 --> 00:08:12,320
Other than you two only having sex once a year,

181
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:14,760
you're the perfect couple.

182
00:08:16,910 --> 00:08:18,410
You-you know about that?

183
00:08:18,410 --> 00:08:21,630
Uh, yeah, everyone at the university does.

184
00:08:22,420 --> 00:08:23,780
Were you aware of this?

185
00:08:23,780 --> 00:08:27,670
No. No, I only told Leonard, Howard, Raj,

186
00:08:27,670 --> 00:08:31,270
Kripke, uh, Professor Wu, Professor Klein,

187
00:08:31,270 --> 00:08:34,090
and a lunch lady in the cafeteria.

188
00:08:34,090 --> 00:08:38,110
How everyone else found out is a mystery to me.

189
00:08:44,410 --> 00:08:45,960
Why aren't you talking to me?

190
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:47,400
Because I'm mad at you.

191
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:50,420
Well, now I'm sorry I asked.

192
00:08:50,950 --> 00:08:53,130
Sheldon, it's humiliating.

193
00:08:53,130 --> 00:08:56,270
Thanks to you, my colleagues are gossiping about our sex life.

194
00:08:56,270 --> 00:08:57,800
What is there to gossip about?

195
00:08:57,800 --> 00:09:00,330
We barely have one.

196
00:09:01,070 --> 00:09:03,800
That's why they're doing it!

197
00:09:07,230 --> 00:09:10,940
Is it safe to assume you're not speaking to me again?

198
00:09:12,180 --> 00:09:14,650
If you're not answering because you're not speaking to me,

199
00:09:14,650 --> 00:09:17,320
perhaps we could come up with a signal!

200
00:09:21,730 --> 00:09:23,500
That works!

201
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:27,510
You don't need your dad's money.

202
00:09:27,510 --> 00:09:29,790
- You can get by on your salary. - Yeah.

203
00:09:29,790 --> 00:09:31,560
Well, we work at the same place as you, and

204
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:33,300
- we've always been fine. - Oh, please.

205
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:37,130
Look in the mirror. You both look ten years older than I do.

206
00:09:38,570 --> 00:09:39,150
All right.

207
00:09:39,150 --> 00:09:40,460
Hang on. We can figure this out.

208
00:09:40,460 --> 00:09:43,530
Let's just go over your expenses. How much is your rent?

209
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:45,770
I don't want to say.

210
00:09:45,770 --> 00:09:47,770
Is it really that high?

211
00:09:47,770 --> 00:09:50,920
I don't want to say because I don't know how much it is.

212
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:52,770
You don't how much your rent is?

213
00:09:52,770 --> 00:09:54,960
My father pays for it! Do you know how much your rent is?!

214
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:55,640
Yeah.

215
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:56,420
Well, then double it,

216
00:09:56,420 --> 00:09:59,910
because my building's a lot nicer than this dump.

217
00:10:01,090 --> 00:10:03,150
Do you know how much your car costs?

218
00:10:03,150 --> 00:10:04,060
Not really.

219
00:10:04,060 --> 00:10:06,720
Well, how much do you spend on food?

220
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:09,380
The housekeeper does the shopping.

221
00:10:10,540 --> 00:10:12,910
Oh, my God, you really are spoiled.

222
00:10:12,910 --> 00:10:13,850
I'm spoiled?!

223
00:10:13,850 --> 00:10:18,370
Your baby has a cape that costs $300!

224
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:24,880
I'm going to bed.

225
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:26,770
Well, wait.

226
00:10:27,130 --> 00:10:30,230
This is our first fight as a couple who live together.

227
00:10:30,230 --> 00:10:31,510
So?

228
00:10:31,510 --> 00:10:33,430
I'm not sure of the protocol.

229
00:10:33,430 --> 00:10:34,560
Television teaches us

230
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:36,250
that the man's supposed to sleep on the couch,

231
00:10:36,250 --> 00:10:40,360
but of the two of us, you're clearly more sofa-sized.

232
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:42,020
I'm not sleeping on the couch

233
00:10:42,020 --> 00:10:44,700
'cause you don't know what's private and what's not.

234
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:46,320
This isn't fair.

235
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:47,710
You've discussed aspects

236
00:10:47,710 --> 00:10:49,530
of our physical relationship with Penny.

237
00:10:49,530 --> 00:10:51,140
That's different!

238
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:53,590
She's a close friend, not the lady in the cafeteria

239
00:10:53,590 --> 00:10:56,370
who cuts the crust off your sandwiches!

240
00:10:56,370 --> 00:10:58,250
That lady has a name.

241
00:10:58,250 --> 00:10:59,410
I don't know what it is,

242
00:10:59,410 --> 00:11:02,580
but one time, I accidentally called her mom?

243
00:11:05,250 --> 00:11:07,950
Sounds like you're gonna need a cheaper place to live.

244
00:11:07,950 --> 00:11:09,630
When you moved here, you didn't have a lot of money.

245
00:11:09,630 --> 00:11:10,930
How'd you get by?

246
00:11:10,930 --> 00:11:12,980
Well, sometimes you can get free food

247
00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:16,130
and Wi-Fi from the neighbors.

248
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:17,540
Just know

249
00:11:17,540 --> 00:11:20,290
you might have to marry one of 'em.

250
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:22,810
Hey, you guys let Stuart live with you.

251
00:11:22,810 --> 00:11:24,550
Why not Raj, too?

252
00:11:24,550 --> 00:11:26,350
What-what are you doing? I...

253
00:11:28,610 --> 00:11:31,390
I-I-I schlepped the baby over, I brought imported beer.

254
00:11:31,390 --> 00:11:33,520
Why don't you like me?

255
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:35,860
Well, I thought we were best friends!

256
00:11:35,860 --> 00:11:36,800
We are!

257
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:40,660
That's why I'm sad my best friend's gonna be homeless.

258
00:11:42,570 --> 00:11:45,240
I'm sorry, Raj. We really just don't have the space.

259
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:46,810
What if he lives in your garage?

260
00:11:46,810 --> 00:11:49,260
What if you stop helping?!

261
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:53,630
Guys, I'm not living in a garage!

262
00:11:53,630 --> 00:11:55,500
Wait. Why are we talking about our place

263
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:59,780
when Sheldon's old room is sitting there perfectly empty?

264
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:03,560
That's a great idea.

265
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:06,850
Raj, if you need a place to stay,

266
00:12:06,850 --> 00:12:09,570
of course you are welcome here.

267
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:12,960
Thank you, but if I'm gonna just take advantage of my friends,

268
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:15,840
I might as well keep on relying on my father.

269
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:17,940
Okay, only if you're sure.

270
00:12:17,940 --> 00:12:19,050
Whew.

271
00:12:19,050 --> 00:12:20,250
Yeah.

272
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:24,020
Amy?

273
00:12:24,370 --> 00:12:25,290
Amy?

274
00:12:25,740 --> 00:12:28,010
- Amy? - Yeah?

275
00:12:28,860 --> 00:12:32,090
Not exactly the welcome wagon, but I'll take it.

276
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:35,770
What is this?

277
00:12:35,770 --> 00:12:38,670
I'm mapping basic topics of conversation

278
00:12:38,670 --> 00:12:41,780
and with whom they can be discussed.

279
00:12:41,780 --> 00:12:45,530
I call these circles Zones of Privacy.

280
00:12:45,530 --> 00:12:46,600
Don't Google that

281
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:49,870
unless you want to see pictures of people's genitals.

282
00:12:50,430 --> 00:12:53,090
This circle contains only me and you.

283
00:12:53,090 --> 00:12:56,080
It represents subjects we only share with each other--

284
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:59,870
details of physical intimacy, bathroom habits.

285
00:12:59,870 --> 00:13:01,800
Although, as I'm saying it,

286
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:04,550
I may need to add Dr. Fink in here.

287
00:13:05,970 --> 00:13:06,820
Are you really worried

288
00:13:06,820 --> 00:13:09,630
about revealing secrets to Stephen Hawking?

289
00:13:09,630 --> 00:13:13,380
No, I was just excited to list him as a friend.

290
00:13:14,330 --> 00:13:17,600
Well, I do appreciate you working on this.

291
00:13:18,620 --> 00:13:21,020
I'm sorry you were embarrassed.

292
00:13:21,020 --> 00:13:22,680
And now I understand that

293
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:25,450
some things are just between you and me,

294
00:13:25,450 --> 00:13:29,560
and in the event of redness and swelling, Dr. Fink.

295
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:34,070
What's that little dot in the middle?

296
00:13:34,070 --> 00:13:37,250
That's reserved for thoughts I don't share with anyone.

297
00:13:37,250 --> 00:13:38,680
Interesting.

298
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:41,430
You really have secrets you don't tell me?

299
00:13:41,430 --> 00:13:43,110
Of course.

300
00:13:43,110 --> 00:13:44,560
Can I hear one?

301
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:47,240
No, they're private.

302
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:50,220
Why? Are they naughty?

303
00:13:51,690 --> 00:13:53,200
A little.

304
00:13:53,510 --> 00:13:55,500
Please?

305
00:13:56,410 --> 00:13:57,470
Fine.

306
00:13:58,420 --> 00:14:00,550
Two years ago...

307
00:14:01,790 --> 00:14:04,750
...I got my driver's license.

308
00:14:06,550 --> 00:14:08,090
What?!

309
00:14:09,470 --> 00:14:11,790
Why didn't you say anything?!

310
00:14:11,790 --> 00:14:14,630
I like being chauffeured around.

311
00:14:14,630 --> 00:14:17,180
It makes me feel important.

312
00:14:18,340 --> 00:14:21,780
So when I got up at 4:00 A.M. to drive you across the desert

313
00:14:21,780 --> 00:14:24,770
to an antique train museum, I didn't have to?

314
00:14:24,770 --> 00:14:26,280
No, you didn't.

315
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:28,220
But keep in mind,

316
00:14:28,220 --> 00:14:31,680
I felt extremely important.

317
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:38,130
What?!

318
00:14:39,750 --> 00:14:40,600
Hello, Father.

319
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:41,780
We need to talk.

320
00:14:41,780 --> 00:14:42,840
All right.

321
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:44,620
I have come to an important decision.

322
00:14:44,620 --> 00:14:47,040
I will not be accepting your money anymore.

323
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:49,480
I'm a man, and I can take care of myself.

324
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:50,810
That's wonderful!

325
00:14:50,810 --> 00:14:51,880
Yes, that is wonderful!

326
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:54,660
You will no longer be able to accuse me of being spoiled!

327
00:14:54,660 --> 00:14:56,310
I am so proud of you.

328
00:14:56,310 --> 00:14:57,440
Dad, I'm trying to tell you off,

329
00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:01,260
and you're ruining it with your delight and relief.

330
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:03,000
Sorry.

331
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:06,570
Oh, no, my grown son is going to stop spending all my money.

332
00:15:06,570 --> 00:15:09,590
Where did I fail as a father?!

333
00:15:10,420 --> 00:15:11,560
Yeah, that's right.

334
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:13,540
Keep asking yourself that!

335
00:15:14,510 --> 00:15:17,920
But I still love you very much, so don't cut me out of the will.

336
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:24,060
Oh, you brought your own lunch.

337
00:15:24,060 --> 00:15:24,910
Good for you.

338
00:15:24,910 --> 00:15:27,140
Yeah, I'm making a bunch of changes.

339
00:15:27,140 --> 00:15:29,570
This morning, I fired my dog walker.

340
00:15:29,570 --> 00:15:31,910
Oh. How's the dog gonna go to the bathroom?

341
00:15:31,910 --> 00:15:33,230
Uh, I gave her an Imodium.

342
00:15:33,230 --> 00:15:35,120
That's tomorrow's problem.

343
00:15:36,950 --> 00:15:40,380
Excuse me. May I have your attention, please?

344
00:15:40,380 --> 00:15:42,400
I have recently been made aware

345
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:45,340
that my personal relationship with Amy Farrah Fowler

346
00:15:45,340 --> 00:15:47,710
has become water cooler gossip.

347
00:15:47,710 --> 00:15:51,480
And I just want to say, shame on all of you.

348
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:53,630
We're scientists.

349
00:15:53,630 --> 00:15:55,290
Our minds should be focused

350
00:15:55,290 --> 00:15:57,540
on the advancement of human knowledge,

351
00:15:57,540 --> 00:16:00,770
not the intimate details of other people's lives.

352
00:16:00,770 --> 00:16:02,580
He's right.

353
00:16:03,030 --> 00:16:05,890
And I'm sorry for the part I played in this.

354
00:16:05,890 --> 00:16:07,050
Thank you, Bert.

355
00:16:07,050 --> 00:16:09,430
You're a good man. That woman who stood you up

356
00:16:09,430 --> 00:16:12,930
and humiliated you last night really missed out.

357
00:16:14,530 --> 00:16:17,390
That doesn't paint me in the best light.

358
00:16:17,390 --> 00:16:19,000
Oh. Oh, I'm sorry.

359
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:24,670
Correction: That woman not only had vigorous coitus with Bert...

360
00:16:24,670 --> 00:16:28,920
she also tipped him a dollar for a job well done.

361
00:16:31,570 --> 00:16:34,100
- That better? - Not really.

362
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:38,610
All right, well, to sum up-- focus on science,

363
00:16:38,610 --> 00:16:40,830
keep your nose out of other people's business,

364
00:16:40,830 --> 00:16:44,090
and, uh, whoa, for a good time, call Bert.

365
00:16:50,570 --> 00:16:52,530
What brought that on?

366
00:16:52,530 --> 00:16:55,290
Well, last night Amy was angry with me

367
00:16:55,290 --> 00:16:57,510
because I'd been foolishly telling people

368
00:16:57,510 --> 00:16:59,350
about certain personal matters.

369
00:16:59,350 --> 00:17:01,020
That's understandable.

370
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:02,510
Oh, I know that now.

371
00:17:02,510 --> 00:17:04,310
At first, I thought she was cranky

372
00:17:04,310 --> 00:17:07,410
because of her horrific menstrual cramps, but...

373
00:17:08,370 --> 00:17:11,310
...it turns out, no, she was genuinely mortified.

374
00:01:31,770 --> 00:01:36,390
